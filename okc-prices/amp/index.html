My primary concerns are my patient’s comfort and getting them the best possible result. I prefer to do blepharoplasty with IV sedation, which is given by an anesthesiologist</p><p>Local anesthetic or freezing is then injected under the skin using a very fine needle. Because the patient is responsive, I can have him or her open and close their eyes to help me judge what I need to do</p><p>This is a very comfortable way to undergo the surgery. Patients remember very little, are quickly alert once the procedure has ended, and can get on their way without the drowsiness and nausea of a general anesthetic</p><h3>Anesthesia for Blepharoplasty</h3><p>Upper eyelid blepharoplasty in Oklahoma City can be performed under local anesthesia with or without sedation. </p><p>Lower eyelid surgery can be a bit more uncomfortable and generally sedation is preferred. IV sedation can make the procedure seem very quick for the patient and they have little to no recollection of the surgery</p><p>Certainly, it is best to have the patient comfortable to keep their blood pressure in normal range to limit bleeding and bruising. </p><h3>Upper eyelid blepharoplasty vs brow lift… or both?</h3><p>An upper eyelid blepharoplasty is used to remove the excess skin of the upper eyelid. This should be done in a conservative way so that the function of the lid is maintained. Overzealous excision of fat and muscle can actually cause the eyes to look hollow and older</p><p>Simple removal of excess skin can be achieved, leaving the eyes looking natural. If their is hooding of the corners of the eyelid, a lateral brow lift can be very helpful and often needed. However, the lateral brow lift can change the appearance, so it is important to evaluate this before deciding to proceed<br>

</div>The good news is, the change is often very subtle and elegant. It only effects the tail of the brow and not the entire brow, so the dreaded “surprised” look is avoided. Depending on the particular case, these procedures can be indicated individually or in combination
<p>A consultation is needed to determine the best approach. </p><p><em>Are you ready for lower eyelid blepharoplasty </em></p><p>Your eyelids are certainly ready for blepharoplasty. Cosmetic surgery on eyes will not stop the aging process, but it could take 10-20 years for the fat to reappear as bags again</p><p>You would require excision of skin, because in your case there would be loose skin and wrinkles remaining if this is not performed. See an experienced surgeon for comprehensive evaluation and discussion of treatment.<br>

</div><h3>When is the ideal time to do a lower eyelid blepharoplasty?</h3><p>Your photo which clearly shows the eye bags with the fat protrusion forwards and over the orbital rim, just held up by the tear trough and orbital retaining ligament</p><p>Your skin looks very good and not wrinkly therefore any surgery can just be on the fat, via a trans-conjunctival approach to either gently reduce the fat or do a fat repositioning over onto the cheek after releasing the septum and ligaments</p><p>NO skin excision appears to be required. An oculoplastic surgeon should assess you and he / she will gently palpate the around the eye and under eye area to determine which particular type of lower eyelid surgery is needed, and advise</p><p>Cosmetic surgery on eyes is done under local anaesthetic with a little sedation. Judging by your photos, you can go ahead with assessment and surgery whenever you wish, the eyebags are ready.<br>

</div>Based on the photos you posted you can expect to have a great result with a blepharoplasty only. This will clean up the eyelids giving you a younger softer more wide eyed look. You will like your results
<p><b>Browlift in the early 20’s</b></p><p>In an aged and heavy brow, a lift might be something to consider. however in your 20’s, a brow lift is likely to look strange or ‘different’. </p><p>In a young and youthful face it is best to avoid procedures that can make you look ‘done’</p><p>If you inherited heavy eyelid skin a conservative lid procedure can be a safe improvement, and Botox can help lift the lateral brow a bit. Be careful what you ask for.<br>

</div><h4>Blepho vs brow lift</h4><p>It is difficult to tell for sure, because your head is tilted in most pictures. It does not look like you need a browlift if anything a very conservative upper lid bleph would be a possibility</p><p>An exam in person would be critical. </p><p><strong>Browlift and/or blepharoplasty</strong></p><p>Based on the few pictures, your brows look very good. If you are only troubled by the eyelid skin, a conservative blepharoplasty in Oklahoma City would do the trick. </p><p><em>Blepharoplasty or Forehead Lift in young patient</em></p><p>I would not recommend surgery to lift eyelids at this time. You have a youthful and probably hereditary fullness of the upper eyelids. I would recommend, however, that you avoid any additional sun damage by sun avoidance, sunscreens and good moisturization of your skin and eyelids<br>

</div><h3>Candidate for Transconjunctival Blepharoplasty</h3><p><b>A transconjunctival blepharoplasty in Oklahoma City</b> is performed when there is fat protruding but excess lower eyelid skin does not need to be removed. For this reason younger patients are frequently the best candidates for this procedure. While complications and side effects can occur with any surgery, they are generally much less frequent with the transconjunctival blepharoplasty where only fat is removed</p><p>Dry eye, ectropion and in ability to fully close the eye are more commonly seen with a subcilliary skin incision. Recovery is also faster in the transconjunctival approach as well. Most swelling is generally resolved within 1-2 weeks</p><p>Trans-conjunctival lower blepharoplasty is the only way we remove fat from the lower lids for the last 20+ years. This approach avoids transecting the muscle so ectropion, dryness and closure are a non-issue. 7-10 days of bruising and swelling will be present for you can go back to work<br>

</div>Please see the link below for examples of trans-conjunctival blepharoplasty. 
<p><em>Blepharoplasty complications</em></p><p>Any time you go for surgery to lift eyelids It is very important to look into the possibility of complications. The was possible complication of Oklahoma City Blepharoplasty is blindness. It has been reported 0.04% of the times and lower eyelid surgery</p><p>It has never been reported in upper eyelid surgery. Most of the complications associated with the lower eyelid surgery. There can be dry eyes afterwards, inability to completely close the eyes, asymmetry, ectropion which is an downward and outward turning of the lower eyelid, loss of eyelashes, change in the color of the skin, prolonged swelling of the white part of the eyeball called chemosis, double vision from injury to one of the muscles during surgery, change in prescription, excess removing of fat leading to hollowness, incomplete removal of fat leaving some bulges, rounding of the eyes which means change in the shape of the eye from Almond to round<br>

</div>There can be other complications not listed above. The best thing to prepare is to ask questions when you have your consultation and ask your doctor if he or she has had any complications and how to handle them
<p>Understanding the complication risk before any surgery is crucial! The most common complications are hematoma (blood clot), asymmetry issues, unfavorable scarring, and bruising. The complication risk is very low for these procedures but they can happen</p><p>If you are ever dissatisfied or notice any issues post operatively it is always best to speak with your plastic surgeon regarding your options. Or discuss how you can prevent these complications as best as possible</p><p><i>Filler vs lower bleph</i></p><p>I recommend lower blepharoplasty with fat preservation. The problem with your lower eyelid is that the fat is bulging through the weak septum. This can be tightened or released to ameliorate the problem. Fillers are not dependable in this area and have a higher risk of complications</p><p>A lower blepharoplasty in Oklahoma City would be the best procedure for you; not a filler. The type of blepharoplasty would preserve your fat and reposition the fat; not remove fat. This can be done through an incision on the inside portion of your lower eyelid with no external scars or incisions</p><p>You do not need any skin removal either. The lower portion of the eyelid which is causing this appearance (septum) needs to be tightened with sutures, this will create a natural appearance and transition from your lower eyelid to cheek<br>

</div>Please consult with a board certified plastic surgeon who is experienced in this particular type of lower eyelid surgery.
<p><i>Blepharoplasty or filler to correct tear troughs</i></p><p>Tear troughs should not be filled with dermal fillers for fear of injecting into the orbital fat, which will then be present for years and will not want to dissipate. A simple transconjunctival lower blepharoplasty can be performed where the fat is removed through the inside incision of the lower lid</p><p>It is important not to take out too much fat; otherwise, a sunken orbital area will result. There are no creams and lotions that will help. It is important to make sure that any preexisting thyroid issues and allergies are addressed prior to undergoing surgery in the lower lids at age 39<br>

</div><h3>Eyelid Surgery Recovery Time</h3><p>In general, it will be only 1 week until you’ll feel ready to go out to dinner with friends or back to work. The most unpredictable factor is bruising. To reduce this, we have our patients avoid vitamin E, fish oil, ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin prior to surgery to lift eyelids</p><p>Generally, stitches are out by 4 to 5 days after surgery to lift eyelids, and makeup can be applied the next day. </p><p><b>Blepharoplasty recovery takes 2 weeks</b></p><p>Approximately two weeks is needed for recovery after a blepharoplasty to ensure all of the bruising, swelling, and ecchymosis is down. We also recommend no exercise for two weeks after the procedure.<br>

</div><h4>Changing the shape of the eyes with surgery.</h4><p>It is possible to change the shape of the eyes with cosmetic under eye surgery. The most important thing to do is to communicate clearly to your surgeon as to what type of shape you desire. Typically eyelid surgery is done to make the eyes look more youthful, not so much to change the shape</p><p>Nevertheless there are a number of techniques to change the shape of the eyes, and depending on your desires the surgeon will use those to achieve the desired result. </p><p><b>Changing eye shape with eyelid surgery</b></p><p>While the most common goals in Blepharoplasty surgery in Oklahoma City include rejuvenation of the face in the area around the eyes, alternative goals may include changing the shape of the eye. In the lower eyelids, this will usually involve eliminating puffiness and/or excess skin<br>

</div>In upper eyelids, this will most commonly involve reduction of a hooded look. In both cases, the result is not only rejuvenation but also a more refreshed look- like you have been on vacation for a month! Some patients, who do not have a natural fold in the upper eyelid, may wish to create upper eyelid dimension
<p>This is most common in Asian patients. Part of the Blepharoplasty may include tightening the lower eyelid or adjusting the position of the outermost aspect of the lower eyelid. In each of these cases, the shape of the eye will change to a degree</p><h4>Arnica and Bromelain are helpful</h4><p>The most important medications to avoid id aspirin and NSAIDs at least two weeks before cosmetic under eye surgery. High doses of Vitamin E also contributes to more bruising. There is scientific data that shows that Arnica and Bromelain are helpful in minimizing bruising after surgery</p><p></p>

</div>More incisions and more tissue undermining adds to more bruising. Today there is an emphasis in minimizing the surgery whenever possible. Regarding the dosage Bromelain dosage is usually 500 Mg once or twice daily. Arnica cream is applied to the bruising site not the incision after surgery
<p><strong>I think you could have help with just the upper blepharoplasty.</strong></p><p>It should be done in such a way so that if you ultimately do need a forehead lift, you have enough skin to do this. The challenge with a forehead lift is that you only need a small lift</p><p>Many surgeons tend to over do these surgeries. If you do decide to have a forehead lift, it should be done endoscopically through small incisions behind the hairline. Do not get talked into a hair line or coronal forehead lift</p><p>The scar even along the hair line is disfiguring. Surgoens will try to convince you that the hairline incision will disappear. It does not. The scar causes hair compression along the scar and this is generally unsatisfactory can leaves people self conscious about the hairline</p><p>All Zip Codes in Oklahoma City, OK: 73101, 73102, 73103, 73104, 73105, 73106, 73107, 73108, 73109, 73110, 73111, 73112, 73113, 73114, 73115, 73116, 73117, 73118, 73119, 73120, 73121, 73122, 73123, 73124, 73125, 73126, 73127, 73128, 73129, 73130, 73131, 73132, 73134, 73135, 73136, 73137, 73139, 73140, 73141, 73142, 73143, 73144, 73145, 73146, 73147, 73148, 73149, 73150, 73151, 73152, 73153, 73154, 73155, 73156, 73157, 73159, 73160, 73162, 73163, 73164, 73165, 73167, 73169, 73170, 73172, 73173, 73178, 73179, 73184, 73189, 73190, 73194, 73195, 73196.</p><p><b>Doctor fee for bottom eyelid surgery in 2015:</b></p><ul>
