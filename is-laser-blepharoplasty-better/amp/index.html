There are additional risks of laser around the eyes. They both last approximately the same time which is 10-15 years.</p><p>As of today, scalpel (or traditional excision) blepharoplasty remains the gold standard. (Rod J. Rohrich, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There are many “tools” for performing blepharoplasty. Even though laser sounds more exciting, traditional blepharoplasty may be better.</p><p>However, it all depends on your anatomy. Also, laser is being marketed for performing blepharoplasty in different ways. Lasers can be used similar to a cautery.</p><p>Laser can be used to resurface the skin. A laser probe can be placed under the skin and melt the fat. So, there are many uses of many lasers.</p><p>These are all questions that you need to ask your surgeon before consenting to surgery. (David Shafer, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I want to have Blepharoplasty for the upper and lower eyelids. I have 2 choices of technique: by laser or by scalpel.</p><p>Which one is better and last longer? the only thing I can say in favor of laser is that it affords the opportunity to laser the skin after the blepharoplasty is completed, other than that, cuttung is cutting. the surgeon is the more important variable.

</div>The laser and scalpel are both surgical instruments which can be used to perform blepharoplasty. The blepharoplasty is done the same way, whether the scalpel or laser is used. There’s no long term data to indicate one is better than the other.
<p>More important then the surgical instrument utilized, is the surgeon’s personal experience with whatever instrument he or she prefers. When considering blepharoplasty it’s important to consider the surgeons experience and reputation. Make sure you consult with a board certified plastic surgeon. (Richard J. Bruneteau, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>Either the laser and scalpel will have good long lasting results. In the short term, the laser surgery may result in less bruising and swelling and a faster recovery however both will “last” the same amount of time. Some surgeons prey on the public’s belief that “laser mus be better” and use it as a marketing ploy however aside from the slightly less bruising and swelling, there is essentially no difference in outcome.
<p>There have been some studies where one eyelid was done with a laser and one with a blade and the patient then was asked after surgery if they could tell which side was which. The patients couldn’t tell and second surgeon looking at the patients postoperatively couldn’t tell either. I have used both and like both. I prefer the CO2 because I feel I get less bleeding thus easier to work with than a blade but that is just my preference. Some surgeons would like the blade better.

</div>Both techniques are good techniques and each patient is considered individually. Traditional techniques have always involved cutting and removing fat. Newer techniques and thoughts involve removing fat and than following up with a laser for skin tightening. 
<p>The best approach to the upper lid is the traditional way of cutting i.e. Blepharoplasty. On the lower lid bothe approaches are acceptable.</p><p>Methodologies are moving toward a lesser invasive technique and removing the fat ie, transconjuntival approach, and then lasering the skin for tightening. This is a a better approach because it preserves the anatomy. You can always come back later and cut the traditional way. Each patient is different and the amount of skin excess also determines the best approach. (Walton Montegut, MD, Newport Beach Physician)</p><p></p>

</div>Both techniques for surgucal removal of excess eyelid skin can be very effective and one tool is not better than the other- just different. The important thing is to choose a board certified plastic surgeon for your eyelid surgery who you trust. The surgeon will have multiple techniques to choose from to decide what is best for your situation. (Caroline H. Chester, MD, Nashville Plastic Surgeon)
<h3>Scalpel or Laser Blepharoplasty Better</h3><p>The quality of a Blepharoplasty is NOT dependent on the tool but rather on the hand that guides the tool. I am sure that I would lose every tennis game holding the most expensive tennis racket made if I faced any of the top 10 players facing me holding only a small frying pan.</p><p></p>

</div>It is well known among surgeons that a scalpel causes a lot LESS trauma and swelling in tissues than does a laser. But, a laser draws easily impressed patients to the operating room and that is the prime reason why surgeons use it briefly to stop bleeding. In fact, it is used as a very expensive cautery unit and offers NO benefits. Pick a good surgeon and you will get good results. (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)
<p>LASERs always sound better in medical and surgical jargon. However, the use of LASERs in lower blepharoplasty is used in the following situations: As a substitute for a scalpel- There really is no difference here between LASER and scalpel here.</p><p>A LASER does have extra risks including heat transfer to surrounding areas and potential damage to the eye. I prefer a scalpel because I feel in my hands it is the best instrument for scarring. </p><p></p>

</div>As a skin tightener- There is no question that LASER can have significant impact in tightening the loose skin around the lower eye, particularly skin which has lost elasticity from sun damage. A well qualified surgeon can discuss the pros and cons of each technique. (Anil R. Shah, MD, Chicago Facial Plastic Surgeon)
<p>I am not a big fan of laser surgery in the eyelid area. Certainly in some cases it can tighten the skin. However, in my experience, a blepharoplasty is a lot more than tightening up the skin. Eyelid surgery is rearranging the complex juxtaposition of skin, fat and muscle that surrounds the eye.</p><p>I am a surgeon and prefer a scalpel for maximum control and my best results. Pick a qualified , board certified plastic surgeon. Also, I have seen many pigmentation problems with laser skin treatments around the eye. Be cautious. Wishing you the best, Tal Raine MD (Talmage J.

</div>In circumstances of upper or lower eyelid surgery, one option is to use a CO2 laser as a cauterizing instrument. CO2 lasers transmit a tremendous amount of heat energy, which correlates with a rather slow recovery.
<p>A scalpel, although old fashioned, has the distinct advantage of a lack of “collateral damage”, and healing is typically much faster. The term “laser Blepharoplasty” is purely a marketing concept which is designed to seduce the patient into believing the procedure is superior because the technology is better. This is a huge misconception. Please understand that Plastic Surgery is subject to the vagaries of the allure of “trendy procedures”, many of which do not prove to be effective. (Stephen Prendiville, MD, Fort Myers Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Laser blepharoplasty is just marketing.</h4><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1464" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

<li>There are no advantages to laser blepharoplasty. Surgical blepharoplasty works well.</li>
<li>Your only important choice is who the surgeon is.</li>
</ol><p>That makes a huge difference. Ask to see lots of before and after pictures. (George J. Beraka, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Lasers don’t always make sense</h3><p>While there are many situations in which lasers can produce results that can not be achieved by other means, blepharoplasty is not one of them. Substituting a laser for a scalpel does not, in my opinion, add any significant benefit. Lasers generally work by heating the target tissue in order to produce their effect. In most instances, there is what’s called a zone of thermal injury, in which the heat produced by the laser causes a variable amount of surrounding tissue damage.</p><p></p>

</div>This effect can be controlled by the settings on the laser, as well as chosing the appropriate device for a patient’s specific problem. In lower and upper eyelid blepharoplasty, there are 3 potential issues that are addressed: skin laxity, fat bulging, and, less frequently, thickened muscle.
<p>Different surgical procedures such as transconjunctival blepharoplasty and external subcilliary approaches are able to take care of 1 or more of those problems.</p><p>The choice of the best procedure is dictated by the patient’s specific anatomical problem. In the perioccular region, lasers are typically used only for skin resurfacing, which can produce tightening of the upper and lower eyelid skin. They are not used, traditionally for fat removal. I would be very reluctant to use a laser that deep within the eyelid. Similar results in skin tightening can also be achieved with chemical peels.<br>

</div>Unfortunately, with laser resurfacing, it can be difficult to predict the amount of skin tightening that occurs. If too much tightening results, then patients can have problems with eye closure as well as contour changes to the lower eyelid or problems with tearing from the eye. 
<p>Chemical peels have a lower risk of this complication, which is why I prefer using that technique in the lower eyelid. All in all, I would recommend a standard blepharoplasty in 99.9% of situations over laser resurfacing alone. </p><p>I would not recommend fat ablation in the lower eyelids with lasers. (Richard W. Westreich, MD, Manhattan Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Laser and scalpel blepharoplasty should give same results</h3><p></p>

</div>Laser blepharoplasty (which I use) and scalpel blepharoplasty, if done correctly by a skilled surgeon, should give you equal results. The reason I use the laser is that the laser seals blood vessels in the incision, thus I find that there is less bleeding, less bruising, quicker procedure, and quicker recovery than blepharoplasty done with a scalpel. I use a transconjunctival laser incision on the inside of the lower eyelid because this approach preserves the support of the lower eyelid and avoids the sad eyed or “hound dog” look that can occur when a blepharoplasty is done through an incision on the outside of the lower eyelid. Laser blepharoplasty has been done for 15 years and several studies have documented the advantages of this technique. Laser blepharoplasty is very safe when done by an experienced surgeon. However, the most important thing for you is to find an expert, board certified plastic surgeon who does a lot of eyelid surgery. The skill of your doctor is more important than the tool used. See before and after pictures of laser blepharoplasty. (Brooke R. Seckel, MD, FACS, Boston Plastic Surgeon)

</div>Lower eyelid blepharoplasty can be performed from both the outside (transcutaneous) or inside (transconjunctival) of the eyelid. 99.9% of the 3000 cases I have performed as an Ocular Plastic Surgeon in Sterling Hieghts, Michigan have been transconjuctival. The advantage of my technique is: NO stitches, NO skin incision, and NO Scalpel blade. I perform the procedure with the MIXTO laser.
<p>This carbon dioxide (CO2) laser allows me to gently remove the fullness (fat) from the inside of the eyelid. The beauty of this laser is that it stops bleeding as it removes this tissue, so the surgery is faster and my patients have less swelling (than traditional scalpel methods) and get back to work faster. Instead of removing skin on the lower eyelids, which can leave a tell tale scar line underneath the lashes, I tighten the skin with the Mixto laser!</p><p></p>

</div>The Mixto is phemomenal to resurface (refresh) the skin. Smoothing of the skin with the laser is a perfect accompaniment to lower eyelid surgery. Both scalpel and laser techniques should have the same longevity. I find faster healing and better skin quality using the laser technique. (Mark Berkowitz, MD, Sterling Heights Oculoplastic Surgeon)
<p>A laser used for cutting in an upper eyyelid surgery is nothing but a fancy marketing ploy. Cutting something with a laser sound really cool but there is no benefit and if anything a significant risk is being taken that is not there with a traditional scalp blade. </p><p>Lasers are very beneficial for resurfacing or fractionated therapy but they currently have no role to be used a cutting device. (Chad K. Wheeler, MD, Spokane Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>If you have a laser, you want to use it to pay for it. In the long run, and even I believe the short run, I see no advantage to using a laser for either long term results, or which is “better”. (Scott E. Kasden, MD, FACS, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)
<h3>Laser is just a fancy cautery</h3><p>The result is much more from the skill of the surgeon and the quality of your starting point than from lasers or scalpels. Personally, I don’t use scalpels or lasers at all. I like to use a very fine tipped electrocautery device (Colorado tip) for the whole surgery, so you can see that there are many ways to do the operations. The cautery and lasers are used to try to prevent bruising and swelling and make the recovery faster, they don’t make the result necessarily better than someone who uses a scalpel. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
