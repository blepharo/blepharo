<span itemprop="articleBody"><p>Cost may vary depending upon geographic area and experience of the surgeon.</p>
<p>Generally, eyelid surgery cost is around 2500-3000 for either upper or lower eyelids and around 4000-4500 for both. (Christopher J. Morea, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>It depends on your location and the practice you are seeing. Eyelid surgery can vary from $2500 to $5000 for a set (either Upper or Lower.)</p>
<p>If you search real self for the procedure, on the top of the page they will usually tell you what the average price consumers in your zip code paid for services. (Christopher Khorsandi, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Average Cost Blepharoplasty</h3>
<p>Cosmetic surgery prices vary based on the region. Remember that your cost has three components: surgeons fee, facility fee, and anesthesia fee.</p>
<p>In general, the only fee that is negotiable is the surgeons fee.Eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty) can go from $2,000-4,000 (in average) and in some areas with high demand for this procedure, the price may be higher.</p>
<p>Price in cosmetic surgery tends to be linked to quality of care which is one of the most important factor to ensure safety and good outcomes during your procedure.</p>
<p>Do your research and make sure you find a well-trained plastic surgeon you can trust. (Jose RodriÂ­guez-Feliz, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_333" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 210px"><meta itemprop="width" content="200"><meta itemprop="height" content="200"><img itemprop="url" itemprop="image" class="size-medium wp-image-333" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/How-much-does-a-blepharoplasty-operation-cost-200x200.jpg" alt="How much does a blepharoplasty operation cost" width="200" height="200" /><p class="wp-caption-text">How much does a blepharoplasty operation cost</p></div>
<p>This varies by region and specialty so you should contact surgeons in your area to get an idea. It likely ranges between $2000-$5000.</p>
<p>Some surgeons do it under straight local and this would be less expensive than a surgeon that prefers to do with intravenous sedation etc.Â You will also find differences between general plastic surgeons, facial plastic surgeons and oculoplastic surgeons.</p>
<p>Find someone that you are comfortable with to do your surgery and do your research from speaking with friends who may have had the surgery &#8211; references are always best and may help put you at ease. (Keshini Parbhu, MD, Orlando Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p>

<p>The upper blepharoplasty is usually about half the price of the lower blepharoplasty which is a much more complicated procedure. My price for the upper is about $2000, and is done using local anesthesia with oral sedation.</p>
<p>An exception to the rule is Asian blepharoplasty which can sometimes be more complicated. (Jeffrey Marvel, MD, Nashville Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>The Cost of Eyelid Surgery is Dependent on Many Factors</h3>
<p>The cost of a blepharoplasty varies depending on whether you are doing the procedure alone or combined with other services. Some of the factors that determine the cost include the amount and complexity of the work that needs to be done, whether the surgery is done in an OR, and the region of the country in which you live. Also, it depends on whether you are having your upper eyelids done, lowers done, or both. (Samuel Baharestani, MD, Long Island Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Eyelid surgery cost</h3>
<p>The cost of blepharoplasty surgery depends on your geographic location as well as the skill and expertise of your plastic surgeon. Choose your surgeon based on their results and credentials. Make sure you have a good rapport with the surgeon. Ask a lot of questions. Get a second opinion if necessary. Best of luck. (Lara Devgan, MD, MPH, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Blepharoplasty costs vary</h3>
<p>Blepharoplasty costs vary. The average price for an upper Blepharoplasty under local is $2,500 to $3750 under general anesthesia.</p>
<p>The average price for a lower Blepharoplasty is slightly more. The price will also vary based on your geographic location, the skill and experience of the plastic surgeon and his board certification. (Daniel Reichner, MD, Newport Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Cost of Eyelid Surgery</h3>
<p>We perform Upper Eyelid Surgery in our office setting for $2,300. This wonderful procedure can make such a difference in a person&#8217;s appearance with little downtime.</p>
<p>Rejuvenating the eye area can instantly create a more youthful appearance. The lower eyelids are generally performed in our operating room with a light sedation.</p>
<p>The cost for lower lids is approximately $3,500. Surgery on the upper and lower lids at the same time costs approximately $5,000. (David Alessi, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Many different types of blepharoplasty</h3>
<p>Typically, uncomplicated upper lid blepharoplasty ranges in cost between $2000 and $3000.</p>
<p>Lower lid blepharoplasty costs are similar, unless very extensive procedures are necessary. (Marcelo Ghersi, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>How much does eyelid surgery cost?</h3>
<p>If surgery is purely cosmetic and if you have upper and lower eyelid surgery, the cost can range from $3000-$6000. However, if the upper eyelids are heavy, they may be covered by insurance. An oculoplastic surgeon or ophthalmologist can asses whether your eyelids are impacting your vision, and can submit the proper documentation to your insurance company for coverage. Lower eyelid surgery is not covered by insurance. (Patrick Flaharty, MD, Bonita Springs Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Costs for Eyelid Surgery</h3>
<p>A blepharoplasty is a great way to look fresher, younger, and more awake! Aging eyelids make you look tired and sick, and no one likes to be asked if they are tired or sick. The cost for Upper Blepharoplasty ranges from 2000-2500, and lower blepharoplasty is 3000-3500. This includes anesthesia which is done by board-certified anesthesiologists. The surgery is done in our AAAHC surgical center. (Melanie L. Petro, MD, Birmingham Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Cost of eyelid surgery</h3>
<p>This varies from office to office. It can range from $2,800 to $4,500. Here&#8217;s a breakdown: Upper eyelid surgery or blepharolplasty is $2,800 to $3,300. If you&#8217;re going to have anesthesia (which you really don&#8217;t need) you may be adding another $1,000. Lower eyelid surgery can be much more variable: Lower eyelid surgery is around $3,000+ for skin only. About $3,500+ for skin and fat. When I&#8217;m performing fat relocation into the hollows of the lower eyelids, and skin excision, and lower eyelid suspension it can be around $4,000. Again, if you&#8217;re going to a separate surgery center or asking for anesthesia you may incur more cost. (Chase Lay, MD, Bay Area Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Blepharoplasty cost in Atlanta</h3>
<p>At our facility we are having a special on the Blepharoplasty thru March 2012. Upper Blepharoplasty Reg. $3,500.00. Special pricing $1,975.00. Lower Blepharoplasty Reg. $3500.00. Special pricing $2,600.00.</p>
<p>If you do both procedures at the same time the cost Reg. $7,000.00/Special pricing $5,200.00. Only additional cost are prescriptions and lab work if needed. Make sure to ask these questions when choosing your surgeon for these procedures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the Physician Board Certified in Plastic Surgery?</li>
<li>Is the Facility a State licensed Facility?</li>
<li>Are there MD Anesthesiologists on Board? Safety first. (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cost of eyelid surgery</h3>
<p>The cost of eyelid surgery is dependent upon 3 fees, which include time in the operating room, time under anesthesia, and the surgeon&#8217;s fee for performing the procedure. It also depends upon whether or not just the uppers, just the lowers, or both are being performed. Eyelid surgery is a very intricate procedure. Some patients only need an upper blepharoplasty, while some patients only need a lower blepharoplasty. Some patients perform both at the same time under one anesthetic and recovery.For many examples of upper and lower blepharoplasty and our current price list, please see the link and video below (William Portuese, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Blepharoplasty cost</h3>
<p>Cosmetic surgery is not a commodity. Techniques, experience, artistic sense, and therefore results (what you get for your money) vary tremendously from one surgeon to the next &#8211; and as such, the cost varies, and should vary, from one surgeon to the next.Â You can find surgeons doing eyelids for $1000 and some doing the same surgery for $6000. This doesn&#8217;t mean that you necessarily get what you pay for since some surgeons are very good at marketing themselves to appear like expert surgeons (one way to do this is simply to charge more) when they are not.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the best way to determine whether the price a surgeon is charging is worth the results, is to go to their Web site and look at his/her &#8220;before and after&#8221; photos.</p>
<p>There should be a LOT of them if the surgeon has the desired experience. Then check to see if the results are CONSISTENTLY excellent, especially look for eyelids that have a similar appearance to yours.</p>
<p>Surgeons with few photos and/or photos demonstrating minimal, inadequate, or undesirable changes obviously should not be charging as much. (Richard Parfitt, MD, Madison Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Blepharoplasty Eyelid Surgery</h3>
<p>The cost of eyelid surgery varies according to the specific concern of my patients and the procedure necessary in order to correct those concerns.Â I offer a complimentary consultation to discuss each individual&#8217;s aesthetic concerns and discuss one or several plans in order to obtain the desired outcome.</p>
<p>Cost can vary, but starts at $1900.00. (Susan M. Hughes, MD, FACS, Cherry Hill Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Eyelid Surgery Cost &#8211; $6200 including the operating room and anesthesiologist</h3>
<p>At our practice upper and lower blepharoplasty will be $6200 including the operating room and anesthesiologist, if you decide to do either upper or lower the price will be $3500.</p>
<p>It all depends on the city that you live. (Jhonny Salomon, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Cost for eyelid reduction in Australia</h3>
<p>In Australia, plastic surgeons on average charge between $1500-3000 for upper or lower eyelid surgery depending on complexity (i.e. skin reduction only, or more complex such as fat or septum redraping, or adjusting upper eyelid dynamics). In my practice, upper or lower eyelids range between $2500-3000. Both upper and lower eyelids average $5000-5500.</p>
<p>This fee covers surgeon fee, assistant, anaesthetist and the hospital fee and is performed in an accredited hospital setting (not an office). Prices often differ more based on complexity rather than upper vs lower eyelids.</p>
<p>In general, if your eyes are symmetrical, lower eyelid surgery is more complex and hence a little more expensive than upper eyelids. (Kevin Ho, MBBS, FRACS, Sydney Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Blepharoplasty Cost: Upper and Lower eyelid surgery</h3>
<p>Eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty) cost varies greatly across the United States.</p>
<p>Eyelid surgery cost is always one of the first questions asked the plastic surgeon.</p>
<p>However, eyelid surgery cost should be taken into consideration with many other factors when choosing your cosmetic facial surgeon, including credentials and board certification.</p>
<p>Eyelid surgery is not one operation, but rather many potential procedures to improve the appearance of the eyes. The cost of eyelid surgery varies greatly, but it&#8217;s usually similar for plastic surgeons in your area.Â For example, northern Virginia upper eyelid surgery may range from $2000 to $5,000 as an example. Lower eyelid surgery may be a little higher, and some patients also require a brow lift in addition to eyelid surgery to maximize aesthetic results.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eyelid surgery cost depends on several factors, but largely dependent on the following:</li>
<li>Region &#8211; Beverly Hills eyelid surgery is more expensive than rural Midwest</li>
<li>Complexity &#8211; Full upper, lower, and brow surgery treating many parts of the area and requiring anesthesia is more expensive than simple procedures isolated to specific areas which may be performed with local anesthesia</li>
<li>Revision eyelid surgery &#8211; Revision surgery is more expensive than primary surgery</li>
<li>Surgeon &#8211; Some plastic surgeons charge significantly more or less than their peers. (Houtan Chaboki, MD, Washington DC Facial Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Eyelid surgery cost</h3>
<p>The rates will vary from city to city and from surgeon to surgeon. There are variables in cost that the surgeon may not be able to do anything about (OR fee, Anesthesia fee, etc;).</p>
<p>Please do not let the cost be your prime concern. Please see a few experienced surgeons before making your choice. (Jeffrey Roth, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Upper and Lower Eyelid Surgery Costs</h3>
<p>Upper eyelid surgery is probably $2000. Lower eyelid surgery depending upon complexity may be $3000 to $5000.</p>
<p>The cost should not be the primary determinant in choosing your surgeon. Find the board certified plastic surgeon with ELITE CREDENTIALS who performs hundreds of eyelid surgeries per year. (Kenneth B. Hughes, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Cost of Eyelid Surgery</h3>
<p>Upper eyelid surgery cost is around $2,500, upper and lower together run around $3,500.</p>
<p>Eyelid surgery can be combined with other facial rejuvenation procedures such as a brow lift of facelift. (David Finkle, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Cost ofÂ eye surgery blepharoplasty</h3>
<p>Fees vary. Upper blepharoplasty done with local anesthesia is 2500 to 3000. Lower eye surgery blepharoplasty is 3500.</p>
<p>Upper and lower blepharoplasty is 5500. In my practice this will include lower eyelid co2 resurfacing when indicated. (Philip Solomon, MD, Toronto Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Eyelid Surgery Cost is Important; But Skill, Safety and Results Demand More Attention</h3>
<p>Never discount your face! While price is a very important factor in making a decision on any cosmetic procedure or surgery, it should never be the most important.</p>
<p>Going to someone just because they charge less may cost you more in the long run, especially if you need a revision. The more important questions are: Is the doctor board certified in a field to perform this procedure? Is the procedure performed in a sterile environment; an operating room or an examination room? Is the doctor performing the anesthesia or is there an anesthesiologist? Can I review the doctor&#8217;s before and after pictures? Can I reach the doctor, AT ALL HOURS, it there is something unexpected? Once you have these answers, then financial questions come.</p>
<p>I perform eyelid surgery in a sterile certified operating room with a Board certified anesthesiologist to keep you safe and comfortable. I use a laser and not a scalpel blade. The advantage of the laser is that it helps to stop bleeding as it contours the skin and fat. The laser can also be used to tighten the excess skin. This allows me to perform No Stitch, No Scalpel, No Skin Incision lower eyelid surgery. My charges are ALL INCLUSIVE and run between $3000- $4000. (Mark Berkowitz, MD, Sterling Heights Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Cost for eyelid surgery</h3>
<p>Upper blepharoplasty (upper eyelid surgery) is commonly done in the office under local anesthesia for about $1,700. Lower eye surgery blepharoplasty (lower eyelid surgery) in also performed in the office under local for about $2,300.</p>
<p>Many patients do both of the procedures at the same time for about $3,500. If you choose to go to a surgery center and undergo general anesthesia the price will be higher as the facility and anesthesia fees are higher. (Christopher T. Maloney Jr., MD, Tucson Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Eyelid surgery cost in Salt Lake City</h3>
<p>In our practice we charge around $2250, including anesthesia, for upper or lower eyelids separately. When done together, we charge $3250 including anesthesia. (Matheson A. Harris, MD, Salt Lake City Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Eyelid Surgery Cost</h3>
<p>The cost of eyelid surgery varies depending on the experience of the surgeon, the duration of surgery, the location of the surgery (office OR vs surgery center), type of anesthesia used (local or IV sedation), the area of the country, and whether just the upper or lower lids are done or all 4 eyelids.</p>
<p>In my practice, we usually perform upper eyelid blepharoplasty in the office under straight local anesthesia, with the total cost being around $2,000. Lower eyelids take a little longer to perform, and for patient comfort I prefer to do them at an outpatient surgery center under IV sedation, although I have performed both lower and upper eyelid blepharoplasy under local anesthesia in the office OR.</p>
<p>Having the surgery in an outpatient surgery center adds the increased costs of anesthesia and operating room charges. In the office OR, the cost of all 4 eyelids would be around $3,300, all inclusive, but if performed at the surgery center, one would have to add another $1,500-$2,000 for the additional anesthesia and facilitiy charges.</p>
<p>There are several variables that can be adjusted, based on the patient&#8217;s and doctor&#8217;s preferences. (Richard G. Schwartz, MD, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Cost of eyelid surgwey</h3>
<p>I can only speak for myself. Upper lids can be done in the office with local anesthesia. We charge $2600; same fee for the last 10 years.</p>
<p>Lower lids usually require an anesthesia in the OR because I am moving the fat of the lower lids into the depression below the eyes, the tear trough.</p>
<p>This is a bit longer procedure and requires a different skill set. We charge $2800 for this.</p>
<p>Hospital and anesthetic fees run about another $1200. Younger surgeons probably charge less. (Stuart H. Bentkover, MD, Boston Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>How Much Does Eyelid Surgery Cost</h3>
<p>The average surgeon&#8217;s fee is 5000.00 for a bilateral upper and lower blepharoplasty. (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Cost of Eyelid Surgery</h3>
<p>I charge $2500 for upper or lower eyelids separately and $4000 for upper and lower lids together. I often do this surgery in my office under local anesthesia.</p>
<p>If patients want to go to sleep for this surgery, it is done in the surgicenter and the fee for this is about $1250. (Jonathan Pontell, MD, FACS, Philadelphia Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Cost of eyelid surgery in Albany NY</h3>
<p>As mentioned by others, what affects the total cost most is whether you are correcting both sets of lids (upper &amp; lower) or one set of lids. At my practice in Albany NY, a standard 4 lid blepharoplasty with skin and fat excision and/or repositioning usually costs in the neighborhood of $6,000.</p>
<p>This price includes all fees (anesthesia, hospital/surgery-center, surgeon fees, etc.). An upper lid blepharoplasty alone (all fees included) is usually under $3,000 while a lower alone (with anesthesia) is usually around $3,500 (because of the fat excisioning and/or repositioning). So you save a bit by doing both together.</p>
<p>The other factor impacting cost is the type of anesthesia needed to safely perform your procedure. Cases that require general anesthesia (e.g. 4 lid blepharoplasty, lower lid cases which involve fat removal and/or repositioning, etc.) will obviously cost more than those requiring only local anesthesia (e.g. some upper lid lifts where only skin is being excised) since general requires an anesthesiologist.</p>
<p>That said, given the delicate nature and complexity of the procedure, do make sure that your surgeon is board certified and has a great deal of experience with facial cosmetic surgery, particularly eyelids. (William F. DeLuca Jr, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>How much does a blepharoplasty cost? Are the prices different for blepharoplasty on the upper eyelids vs. the lower eyelids?</h3>
<p>In our offfice an upper eyelid blepharoplasty costs about $2200 under local anesthesia. There is no need for general anesthesia for this operation. However, if a patient prefers general, the price will be another $600 or so. The lower eyelid blepharoplasty is the same in our practice.</p>
<p>For both upper and lower lids, the price is about $4500 to $5000 according to the complexity, and whether a laser is also needed for the lower lids.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that often the upper lids sag because of a sagging brow, or sometimes there is a combination of brow and eyelid problems.</p>
<p>For the optimum results, your PS will advise you on the best course to take. The price for all 4 lids and a brow lift would be about $6 to 7000, and this would include general anesthesia. (E. Ronald Finger, MD, Savannah Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Cost of Eyelid Surgery</h3>
<p>In my practice, the upper eyelid blepharoplasty is a fairly standardized surgery if we are not adjusting the lid margin for ptosis. We generally charge about $2400 for the upper lid blepharoplasty. Select patients can be done in office with very little discomfort while others do well with a brief anesthetic depending on the amount of fat recontouring necessary. Anesthesia and Facility fees may apply. There are no fewer than 4 significant variations that we use for the lower eyelid complex. This usually involves removing any excess skin, improving texture with peels or lasers, and recontouring the fat to remove bags under the eyes. Most patients choose to be under a twighlight or brief anesthetic for lower eyelid surgery. Our average charge for lower eyelid surgery is $2800 depending on the approach needed for the individual. Additional fees may apply for surgical center or anesthesia requirements. I hope that provides some direction. Remember that patients deserve value but quality lasts forever. I would recommend visiting no fewer than 3 qualified plastic surgeons to discuss recommendations before making any life long decisions. (Todd Christopher Hobgood, MD, Phoenix Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Eyelid surgery cost variable</h3>
<p>Eyelid surgery price varies with the number of eyelids being operated upon and the amount of skin and fat that needs to be removed.</p>
<p>It also varies with the region of the country and from city to city. It also varies depending on whether the surgery is done in a hospital setting, outpatient surgery center, or the doctor&#8217;s office.</p>
<p>It is best to call the individual doctor&#8217;s office to inquire about how it is done and the fees. Often a free consultation is available at many doctor&#8217;s offices. (James Tang, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Blepharoplasty Costs</h3>
<p>There are many factors in seeking out how much a eyelid surgery costs. Many colleagues in a given geographic area seem to have similar pricing with a nominal difference based on expertise.</p>
<p>As with any surgery, it is better to seek someone who is well regarded in the procedure and works on an area frequently.</p>
<p>Factors which can alter price: In office versus in a surgery center- Many surgeons experienced in local anesthesia may be able to perform the procedure in the office, often saving the patient at least $2000 in facility and anesthesia fees.</p>
<p>In my office, for some isolated eyelid procedures, we are able to do the procedure comfortably with minimal sedation in the office. Type of procedure &#8211; Ñyelid surgery procedures can vary tremendously. In some cases, fat is removed, lid creases are reset, etc. More work typically translates to a higher price. (Anil R. Shah, MD, Chicago Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Cost of Blepharoplasty</h3>
<p>A lot of variability because as many have said it depends on the procedure, whether you do it under local or with anesthesia or in the lower eyelids are you adding fat or repositioning the fat or in some cases removing fat. Also in the upper eyelids one an release the periosteum at the brow, etc. (Cynthia Boxrud, MD, Santa Monica Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Prices for blepharoplasty varies.</h3>
<p>The price for eyelid lifts definitely vary per surgeon and per area (upper versus lower lids). Also, the requirement of anesthesia versus doing the procedure under local will affect price. If anesthesia is used, there will be a fee for this. Different surgeons have different costs as well and some may vary cost based on the degree of correction necessary. (David Rankin, MD, Jupiter Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Eyelid surgery price depend on the complexity of the surgery</h3>
<p>Prices will vary depending on the skill and experience of your Plastic Surgeon. Pricing also depends on the complexity of the surgery. At my clinic, the fee for these procedures include the surgical fee, operating room fee, anesthesia fee and all follow up visits. (Frank Lista, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Prices for eyelid surgery can be deceiving</h3>
<p>Of all the procedures that you can undertake with a plastic surgeon, the lower eyelids are the riskiest. It is for this reason that eyelid procedures should be performed by those with lots of experience. You will find that the price is often not related to skill levels. Many doctors elevate their prices to make them appear more skilled &#8211; the emperors new robe. Talk to the doctors &#8211; talk to their patients &#8211; you will certainly be able to find a good doctor within the average price range. (Robert M. Freund, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>A wide variation in eyelid surgery cost exists</h3>
<p>Pricing on eyelid surgery surgery will vary widely depending on many factors. The location of the surgeon, the surgeon&#8217;s expertise, the surgeon&#8217;s specialty (may be performed by plastic surgeons, oculoplastic surgeons, facial plastic surgeons, other cosmetic surgeons), the amount of work that needs to be done, can all affect the price. Generally, most surgeons price upper and lower eyelids similarly and a discount is usually built in for doing both at the same time. A range for upper lids, taking into account all of these factors, could be as wide as $1500-$6000 or $7000. I suggest obtaining a more narrow range for your geographic by calling around to a few plastic surgeons in your area. Many will give you a range over the phone. (Kenneth R. Francis, MD, FACS, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Blepharoplasty price will vary</h3>
<p>The price of blepharoplasty varies. Upper eyelid blepharoplasty usually requires less work versus the lower eyelids- thecost of upper eyelid surgery should be less versus lower eyelid surgery.</p>
<p>Most of the time removal of excess skin and fat from the lower eyelid requires tightening, a canthopexy, to reduce the chance of a malpositioned lower eyelid after surgery. In some instances only fat removal is necessary &#8211; reduicng the surgeon&#8217;s fee.</p>
<p>Sometimes fat grafting, the addition of fat to the eyelid is indicated and is a growing trend. This may increase the cost of the procedure if performed with blepharoplasty. The surgeon&#8217;s fee is usually separate from the fees associated with use of the operating room (facility fee) and the anesthesiologists fee. If these procedures are performed in an office setting significant cost savings is the rule. (Adam J. Cohen, MD, Skokie Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>Price will vary based on whether upper lids are being done, lower lids are being done, both are being done, and exactly what technique needs to be used. There are many different types of eyelifts just as there are many different types of breast lifts. Depending on how many hours the surgery will take, OR and anesthesia costs will vary. Costs furthermore vary from region to region throughout the country. Your best bet is to go see a plastic surgeon, find out what procedure will work best, and go from there! Good luck! (Evan Sorokin, MD, Cherry Hill Plastic Surgeon)</p>
