Ultherapy is the only FDA approved device for non-surgical facelifting.</p><p>Treating the eyebrows and tissues around the eyes can tighten and lift the eyebrows and lids while smoothing the wrinkles around the eyes. This is a completely non-invasive technology (no injections) done in the office with no downtime. Results can last up to two years. (Patrick Flaharty, MD, Bonita Springs Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nonsurgical Eyelid Lift – will it work?</h3><p>There are many factors that contribute to the drooping eyelid and only a careful analysis of all of those issues can provide a satisfactory answer to your unique situation and determine what, if anything, will meet your expectations.</p><p>In general, nonsurgical options will only offer limited results, aka amount of lift. If a minimal or modest improvement would be of value, consider skin resurfacing techniques (lasers, micro dermabrasions, peels) and neurotoxins.</p><p>And, as previously mentioned, stay well hydrated and limit salt intake. (Ellen A. Mahony, MD, Westport Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Alternatives to Eyelid Surgery</h3><p>In my practice, laser can occassionally replace surgery. Another alternative in our practice is Ulthera, but we are very careful during any treatment near the orbital rim.  ( Stefan Mark Szczerba, MD , Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Alternatives to Eyelift Surgery</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_439" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Sometimes wrinkles of the lower eyelids can be addressed with laser treatments or a chemical peel, and bags can be improved with injectable fillers or fat grafting.</p><p>However, the upper eyelids need surgery for a meaningful improvement. ( Thomas A. Mustoe, MD, FACS , Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Small surgery goes a long way</h3><p>The upper and lower lids of the aging face respond very differently to treatment options. Typically, the droopy upper lid responds very well to blepharoplasty. This is a very small operation that can be done under local anesthesia and can have profound effects. Unfortunately non surgical options do not work very well in the upper lid. The lower lid is a different story. The tear trough responds very well to facial fillers.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_438" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The lateral eyelid also responds very well to botulinum toxin for the “crows feet” area. Also, chemical and laser resurfacing agents work very well for loose skin of the lower lid. ( Marcelo Ghersi, MD , Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Droopy Eyelids do have alternatives that are nonsurgical…</h3><p>Yes an eye lift also know as a upper-blepharoplasty would be the right way to reduce the droopy eyelids, however if you are not ready to go under the knife there are alternatives.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_437" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>With the use of neurotoxin’s such as Xeomin and Botox these products can lift the brow which sometimes creates a heavy lid appearance. Some patients think they may need their eyelids done but in fact have a heavy brow and with the use of neurotoxin’s or an Endoscopic Brow Lift the brow is put back into its natural position which will reduce the look of the droopy eyelids. If you opt for a non-surgical or surgical approach both with make your eyes look more open and you will look less tired. ( Z. Paul Lorenc, MD , Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Droopy Eyelids</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_440" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Realize that there can be different causes for “droopy lids”. If the problem is excessive stretchy skin, then surgery may be the best treatment. However, non-surgical alternatives would include topical skin products that firm up the skin temporarily, skin peels that can also firm up the skin, laser treatments which can tighten collagen fibers in the skin and also smooth fine skin lines, and even Botox injections just below the eyebrows that might cause the brows to rise, therebye elevating the lid skin just very slightly.</p><p>Be aware that if the entire eyelid is sitting low over the pupil (as opposed to an extra fold of droopy skin), then you might have a condition called “ptosis” that requires a different approach than a purely cosmetic one. ( Richard G. Schwartz, MD , West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Droopy Eyelids – Alternatives to lower eyelid blepharoplasty?</h3><p>The options for nonsurgical alternatives to upper eyelift are few. First, one must keep in good health and avoid salty foods, avoid sun over exposure, avoid excessive alcohol intake, exercise regularly, and maintain routine skin care.</p><p>Botox by an experienced physician can work wonders but the gold standard is the surgical blepharoplasty. ( Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD , Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nonsurgical eyelid lift</h3><p>There are some nonsurgical ways to improve sagging eyelids, but lower eyelid blepharoplasty is the most effective. I use Fraxel Laser Resurfacing and Ultherapy to lift and tighten the excess skin over the upper eyelids. Botox can also be used to lift the brows which can temporarily improve excess upper eyelid skin. ( Jonathan Pontell, MD, FACS , Philadelphia Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Alternatives to lower eyelid blepharoplasty</h3><p>The alternative to doing lower eyelid blepharoplasty is doing Botox, which can be done with finesse by an experienced Botox injector. If one has sagging brows then an endotemporal browlift may be in order.</p><p>If you have redundant skin over hanging your upper eyelashes then a blepharoplasty may be done solely or in combination. It is important to see an experienced Board Certified Plastic Surgeon or Oculoplastic Surgeon with expertise in these areas. ( Rod J. Rohrich, MD , Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>A possible alternative to lower eyelid blepharoplasty</h3><p>Although a surgical procedure is the most effective way to treat upper eyelid hooding, a surrogate, less invasive procedure can be performed. In many cases, eyelid hooding is worsened by a progressive drop in the position of the eyebrow. This is most dramatic on the lateral aspect (towards the ear) aspect. Therefore, a “chemical browlift” could help.</p><p>This is done by injecting small amounts of a neuromodulator like Botox or Dysport UNDER the brow. The product effectively weakens the portion of muscle responsible for pulling down on the brow. If this is weakened, it allows for the forehead muscle to pull up on the brow and may make the eyelids look better at the same time. This effect is variable in different patients, but may be an option for you if you want to avoid lower eyelid blepharoplasty. ( Michael M. Kim, MD , Portland Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Minimally invasive options to rejuvenate the eyes and forehead</h3><p>The effects of age, sun, genetics and facial expression have additive effects in and around the eyes. The most common complaint I receive on consultation are a tired or sad appearance. For the most part this is secondary to decended brows which actually can cause a redundancy of skin in the upper lids. The “bags” under the eyes are secondary to pseudoherniated fat and a decent of the midfacial soft tissues.</p><p>To correct these a variety of soft tissue fillers and neuromodulatos such as Dysport or Botox can be used to accentuate the correct areas and cause elevation of the brows. This added with a good skin care regimen and a resurfacing procedure such as a chemical peel or laser treatment can result in a dramatic effect. An in office consultation is necessary to determine the correct procedure and a personally tailored treatment plan. ( Giancarlo Zuliani, MD , Rochester Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Non surgical eyelid lift</h3><p>The most reliable option would be the use of Botox to elevate the lateral eyebrow and take up some of the skin excess there.</p><p>The more medial part is more difficult to correct with Botox, but as long as only the depressors of the eyelid are injected medially, that will help for the medial portion also. ( Julio Garcia, MD , Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Options if you don’t want upper eyelid surgery</h3><p>Unfortunately, there are no other options that work good, if you do not want upper eyelid surgery. There is no way to shrink skin on the upper eyelid. (Bivik Shah, MD , Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Eyelids</h3><p>Are you referring to your lower or upper lids or both? There are non-surgical methods to treat specific problems or concerns but you should post pictures so that we can specifically address your concerns.</p><p>Botox/Fillers/laser treatments can all be use to treat eyelids. Again, please post some pictures so that we can address your specific concerns. (Asif Pirani, MD, FRCS(C), Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Botox &amp; Juvederm May Help Correct Sagging Eyelids</h3><p>The area around the eyes is usually the first area to show the effects of facial aging. This not only makes us look older, but also makes us look tired.</p><p>Many patients would like to address this problem but aren’t quite ready for surgery. Non surgical alternatives are very attractive to this group of people.</p><p>It’s important to realize that these modalities of treatment are temporizing maneuvers and that for most people blepharoplasty surgery will ultimately be necessary to fix their problem.</p><p>Even when we set the clock back, it continues to tick. There are several categories of non surgical treatment of the peri-orbital region.</p><p>These include life style modifications, the use of injectable fillers, botox injections and skin re-surfacing. Each of these approaches has limited value in improving the appearance of the peri-orbital region.</p><p>Life style changes can be somewhat helpful. Examples might include lowering salt intake, getting more sleep, optimizing treatment of allergies and maintaining proper hydration.</p><p>In some cases the strategic use of botox can create mild brow elevation that may also impact the eyelid. Botox can also decrease fine wrinkles of the lower eyelids and crowsfeet at the corners of the eyes. Occasionally injectable fillers such as juvederm and restylene can be used to fill in tear trough deformities to minimize the impact of lower lid fat accumulations. Skin resurfacing with chemical peels and lasers can help to minimize fine wrinkles that occur around the eyes.</p><p>All of these treatments can help buy time, but when peri-orbital aging is severe more aggressive maneuvers are necessary. Under these circumstances blepharoplasty surgery and browlift surgery may need to be considered.</p><p>Every patient’s situation is unique and therefore treatment needs to be individualized. If your considering treatment of your eyelids make sure you consult a board certified plastic surgeon. (Richard J. Bruneteau, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nonosurgical eyelift alternatives include fractional CO2 refurfacing</h3><p>The upper eyelid and brow complex can be treated with a number of modalities in those patients who are not interested in surgical correction. Fractional CO2 resurfacing can be a good treatment for upper eyelid redundancy.</p><p>For anyone who is familar with this technique, the skin contraction can be appreciated immediately.</p><p>It also can be repeated in 3 to 6 months for additional lifting. The brow on the otherhand, can be lifted with ultrasound based treatments such as Ultherapy.</p><p>Lower eyelid skin laxity can be improved again with Fractional CO2 or chemical peel, although this does not address fat herniation which can be camouflaged only go so far with fillers. Significan festooning requires blepharoplasty surgery in my opinon. Some people have played with percutaneous laser treatments and detergent like injections however I would hesitate to suggest this as it is simply too unpredictable and risky. A transconjunctival blepharoplasty surgery by a well trained clinician is in reality less risky than these procedures. (Arthur N. Falk, MD, Albany Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Alternatives to eyelid surgery or blepharoplasty</h3><p>First, there is no replacement for blepharoplasty surgery for ptosis. However, there are non-surgical options that may aid in the lifting of the brow or tightening eyelid skin to yield an improves appearance. BOTOX injections can help raise the brow, skin tightening treatments like Ultherapy or Viora may help firm eyelids and raise brow as well. An in-person consultation is always best as ptosis is different with each patient. (Daniel J. Ritacca, MD, Chicago Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p></div>
