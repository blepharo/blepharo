<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Blepharoplasty in New Mexico can be done under local anesthesia only or with IV sedation. In my practice, 90% of upper lid and 10% of lower lid blepharoplasties are done under local anesthesia only, half are supplemented with oral Valium</p><p>The rest choose to have IV sedation. </p><p>Blepharoplasty can be done done awake or asleep with the choice up to you. The choice depends on what you are most comfortable with.  Upper eyelids can be done with local sedation unless a patient is restless and anxious-I don’t do lower eyelid surgery under local because it is more difficult on the patient. </p><h4>Lower lid bleph</h4><p>If your lower lids bother you, and you are prepared to undergo a eyelid surgery to correct these, then there is no benefit to waiting. Seek an opinion from a board certified surgeon. </p><p>You are the “poster child” of someone who would benefit from a lower lid bleph.  Find someone with experience, a good reputation, and that you feel comfortable with.  </p><p>you appear to be a good candidate for lower eyelid blepharoplasty in New Mexico. It is a little unusual for lower eyelid bags to develop in just 1 year. Weighty loss, thyroid disease, fluid retention, as well as many other conditions can cause the eyelids to become “puffy” relatively quickly</p><p>While this likely that your appearance is a normal part of the aging process, you should see an accredited oculoplastic surgeon to confirm nothing else is going on.</p><p><b>Upper Eyelid Swelling After Blepharoplasty</b></p><p>Swelling one week after an upper lid blepharoplasty is certainly not unusual, and laying down or leaning forward will cause it to swell more. I doubt if your PS injected a filler at all without telling you he did so<br>

</div>I recommend asking him. You may see bruising for months after any type of plastic surgery. You should visit your PS and get an explanation. My bet is that he mentioned you how much swelling to expect
<p>Generally, there is so much information given that a patient misses a point or two during the conversation. We give the patient a booklet with post op expectations, so there are not surprises. </p><p>Eyelid swelling is normal after blepharoplasty procedure in New Mexico and occurs for about 2 weeks. I would recommend keeping your face elevated as laying down will cause swelling. If you are still concerned after a couple of weeks, consult with your physician<br>

<b>Elevating Your Head at Night Following Blepharoplasty May Help Accelerate Your Recovery & Alleviate Your Swelling</b><p>Eyelid swelling is extremely common following blepharoplasty. Following baggy eye surgery, the majority of the swelling has disappeared in about a week, but small amounts may persist for up to a month. The swelling is typically worse in the morning, after lying down all night</p><p>It tends to improve during the day when the patient is in the upright position. It appears that your swelling is probably normal and would be anticipated after this type of procedure. Elevating your head at night might accelerate your recovery</p><p>If the swelling fails to improve, make sure that you discuss the issue with your plastic surgeon.<br>

<b>Fillers or blepharoplasty for tear troughs</b><p>Examination in person would help determine whether you have excess fat above your tear troughs or not. Either way, Hyaluronic acide fillers such as Restylane or Juvederme Plus give nice results in this area with a good longevity</p><p>I would avoid thicker fillers such as Perlane or Juvederme Ultra Plus as they are more likely to cause irregularities in a thin-skinned area such as the tear trough. Fat is also an option that requires a great deal of experience on the part of the sugeon in an unforgiving area such as the tear trough</p><p>Finally, if you do have excess rbital fat above the tear troughs, which doe not appear to be the case from your picture, a blepharoplasty with fat transposition in New Mexico would provide a nice result. This can be performed either through the conjunctiva or through an incision under the eyelashes, with the latter being my preferred method<br>

<strong>A transconjunctival approach to remove / reposition some of the excessive lower eyelid fat which is creating this shadow effect</strong><p>The dark circles in your lower eyelids are due to a combination of a shadow effect, as the light hits the puffiness in your lower eyes, along with some loss of soft tissue volume in the infra-orbital rim region</p><p>Puffiness in the lower eyelids causes a shadow effect adjacent to where the puffiness is which accentuates the impression of a “dark circle”. I would, in fact, use a transconjunctival approach to address your concerns</p><p>Through this approach, some of the excessive lower eyelid fat which is creating this shadow effect and puffiness can be either removed or repositioned, as needed to correct the problem. In addition to repositioning the fat that is already there, I will often move some fat up into the tear trough area from the cheeks, through this approach, to further improve the appearance of your lower eyelids<br>

</div>If you choose to use a temporary injectable filler instead of opting for the surgical approach, Restylane® is a very good choice and it can be placed as close to the inner corner of the eye as you would like
<p>Ptosis or droopiness can be due to the brow position, heaviness of the eyelid tissues and/or “intrinsic” ptosis due to poor function of the eyelid lifting muscle itself. Typically eyelid surgery in New Mexico does not involve correction of “intrinsic” ptosis as that is a more specialized procedure and not commonly needed</p><p>It will be up to your surgeon to determine if your condition is primarily cosmetic (much more common) or if you have a medical condition that is obstructing your vision. If so, with proper documentation it may be covered by insurance but that should be clearly sorted out prior to eyelid surgery in New Mexico<br>

<b>Blepahroplasty and ptosis</b><p>While in many cases ptosis repair can be done at the same time as a blepahroplasty, only ptosis repaiur can be covered by insurance. </p><p><strong>Bleph and ptosis repair are 2 different things</strong></p><p>The bleph is cosmetic unless you have visual field obstruction and the ptosis repair is medically necessary. While they can be done together, their billing is a separate thing regardless of where you have it done</p><p>You certainly have surgery as an option, but given your age and lack of loose skin, fillers may be better as a starting point. We prefer Restylane under the eyes and you can see examples of before and after pictures for eye bag injections at the link below<br>

<strong>Fixing a Drooping Upper Eyelid</strong><p>Sometimes, as we get older, the muscle and connective tissue sling that holds up the upper eyelid will stretch and even “let go.” This causes a problem called “ptosis” and can be repaired surgically</p><p>Depending on your specific anatomy, and the degree of the ptosis, as well as the need for skin removal on the upper eyelid, the approach can be from the outside (external levator repair) or inside of the eyelid (Muellerectomy)</p><p><i>How to fix one drooping eye.</i></p><p>Hard to get a handle on what you actually have without photos or an exam. the eye droop can be a variety of things. Sometimes other issues, (a droopy brow), can effect the eyelid. Best to go to an experienced eyelid surgeon<br>

</div>He/she will examine you and make a plan. 
<p> A comprehensive examination is necessary to determine your best course of action. From your pictures you do have brow ptosis, affecting the medial (inside) brow more than temporal ( outside)</p><p>This is why you have formed the 11 lines centrally. Both a brow lift and blepharoplasty in New Mexico should be considered. While a brow lift can give the best aesthetic outcome, that does not mean you have to have this surgical procedure! You could have a conservative blepharoplasty alone</p><p>This could be enhanced with botox to decrease the 11 lines and filler to elevate the brow. make sure to discuss all options with your cosmsetic surgeon.<br>

</div>In these photos, your brow appears to be at a good height, and has a good arch. Therefore you should be able to do just the upper lids. If you want, try some botox to the outer brow which will give you a temporal brow elevation
<p>If you like the way you look with a higher brow than you could do both. Can also do botox after eyelid surgery if need a little brow elevation. </p><h3>Brow and Blepharoplasty</h3><p>Both your consultants are correct. You could do either procedure or choose one. I tend to believe that in this situation for most patients the best long term and good looking result will result if your do both procedures</p><p>It is possible for a patient to get an improvement in how things look and an improvement in any visual obscuration if they do only one of the procedures. If the on examination it can be seen that there is an excess of upper eyelid skin and a lower positioned brow then there is opportunity to optimize the anatomy of both the eyelids and the brow</p><p>By correcting both components, I believe, one can achieve the best long lasting and effective improvement.</p><p><b>Blepharoplasty better than browlift</b></p><p>I think your main problem is you upper eyelids and you would do just fine with an upper blepharoplasty. You may find that your eyebrows are artificially raised in order to get the upper eyelid skin out of the way of your vision and it is not unusual for the brows to descend a bit after upper blephs<br>

</div>You can then manage this with botox 
<p>The photos show that your brow has dropped and that you have excess eyelid skin. You therefore need to have both a brow lift and a blepharoplasty. I see that you are leery of a surgical brow lift</p><p>In that case you could try a chemical brow lift with fillers and Botox. This may be enough for you and is easy to do. It’s worth a try as you can always do a surgical brow lift later on</p><p><i>Blepharoplasty or brow lift</i></p><p>Just based on the photos you provided I agree with the plastic surgeon that you would benefit from a brow lift. The inner portion of your brow is being brought down by the brow muscles and is giving you deep lines in that area (number 11)<br>

</div>These muscles can be addressed through an endoscopic brow lift or through the upper eyelid during belpharoplasty. The tail of the brow seems to be in a good position, however a mini lift of the tail of the brow will complement the blepharoplasty results especially on the sides
<p><b>Can lower lid fat be removed with surgery?</b></p><p>The answer is no but you may be a candidate for Restylane to disguise the remaining fat pad. It all depends on how prominent the fat pad is. If it’s too big to hide then baggy eye surgery can be performed again</p><p>Even with scar tissue, blepharoplasty surgery can be performed successfully. An oculoplastic surgeon would be an excellent choice as they specialize in eyelid surgery and are thus very familiar with the anatomy. </p><h5>Showering is usually ok a few days after cosmetic surgery eyelids</h5><p>1. I usually ask patients to keep the surgical area dry for 3-5 days after eye lid surgery depending on what was done.<br>
2. Always check with your surgeon before getting surgical sites wet since there is no hard rule or guideline that says when it is safe to shower</p><h5>Can I Shower after eyelid lifting?- Yes:Soap and Water Does Not Cause Infection</h5><p>After surgical repair of the eyelid, most patients feel relieved, but still a bit stressed out. Taking a nice warm shower is just the thing to feel better. Soap and water do not cause infections, but if you have drains or tubes in place to let out fluid after surgery for eyelid droop, then you may not be able to get into the shower until those are removed</p><p>It is best to check with your own surgeon, but all my patients are allowed to shower as soon as they get home after eyelid surgery in New Mexico. </p><p></p>
