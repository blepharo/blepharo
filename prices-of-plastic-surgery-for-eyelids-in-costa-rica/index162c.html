<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Eyelid surgery, or “blepharoplasty”, when performed for cosmetic reasons in Costa Rica, serves to remove heavy skin of the upper lids. Occasionally this involves removal of a small strip of muscle and may also include the removal of fat that has herniated out from behind the muscle</p><p>Usually, the decision about what to remove and how much to remove is made by your surgeon. </p><h5>Scar Revision post Blepharoplasty</h5><p>Upperlid scars are rare when the surgery is performed by an experienced and expert board certified plastic surgeon. The problem can be improved by scar revision. Ensure that the scar revision is performed by an experienced and expert board certified plastic surgeon</p><p>Unfortunately, after 18 months one would not expect a significant change in scarring. Usually, eyelid scars healed nicely but occasionally there may be some problem scars. Genetics may play a role as may technique</p><p>It would be appropriate at this time to discuss your concerns with your surgeon. Often, a local revision of the scars is possible. This can usually be easily performed under local anesthesia. </p><h5>Scars after Blepharoplasty</h5><p>There really should not be visible scars following a blepharoplasty in Costa Rica. It is hard to know how to approach your issue without a photo. </p><p>However, please know that your situation can be improved. Find a plastic surgeon with a lot of eyelid revision surgery</p><p>Virtually any eyelid surgery can be revised with improved results. Unfortunately not all cosmetic surgeries delivery everything we hoped for. Sometimes this is the fault of the surgeon, sometimes though it is because both the patient and the surgeon failed to communicate, and sometimes despite every best effort, things do not go as planned<br>

</div>However, it is important to understand that eyelid surgeons come with a range of skill sets. I would encourage you to seek second opinions for expert surgeons who specialize to correcting unsuccessful eyelid surgeries. This will not be the plastic surgeon down the street who did your girl friends breast reduction or the ophthalmologist that fixed your grandmothers tearing problem
<p>I encourage you to look at my website which has a lot of information about fixing these types of situation. However, there are a number of specialists in Florida you can see who can address these issues</p><p><i>Reversing eyelid surgery</i></p><p>Certain aspects of a blepharoplasty in Costa Rica can be partially reversed, but some cannot. It is impossible to tell what correction can be attempted without knowing what your anatomy was to begin with, what specifically was done in bottom eyelid surgery, and what your current goals are<br>
</p>

</div>Hollowness due to excess fat removal can be partially or completely reverse with fat grafts. However, if there is not orbital fat available to graft, the surgeon has to use fat from other areas of the body and this fat may not act exactly like orbital fat as you gain and lose weight over your lifetime
<h3>Hollowness After Upper / Lower Blepharoplasty</h3><p>Without an examination, it is impossible to determine what will provide you correction. Several things are possible, however. Although the trend in Blepharoplasty is to remove no fat, a large number of surgeons doing eyelid surgery still remove significant fat from both lids</p><p>At one time this was the accepted way to do the bottom eyelid surgery. If you are simply missing fat from over resection, then fat injection alone may solve your problem. </p><p>Frequently lower Blepharoplasty in Costa Rica only removes some eyelid skin without repositioning the cheek<br>

</div>This, too, can cause a hollow appearance to the lower lids. If this is a cause, then revision surgery that elevates the entire cheek may also be needed. 
<p><i>Brow and eyelid surgery together or alone</i></p><p>All three procedures can be safely performed at the same time with a very good result. There is nothing wrong with breaking up the procedures, but it is not necessarily a guarantee for better symmetry</p><p>It is often very easy to have a procedure under local anesthetic if needed to correct any small asymmetries that may occur after swelling resolves. </p><p><em>Combining Browlift with Upper and Lower Blepharoplasty</em></p><p>There are multiple procedures that can be performed to rejuvenating the eyes. To address the upper eyes a browlift or upper blepharoplasty can be performed. These can be performed simultaneously, although frequently they are completed at separate times to give you the best result<br>

</div>The browlift results often can relax a bit around 6 months after bottom eyelid surgery and this is a good time to perform the blepharoplasty. The lower eyelid surgery can be performed simultaneously with either the browlift or upper blepharoplasty in Costa Rica
<p>This two step approach can be a better approach for you with only two recovery periods instead of three. </p><h3>Skin pinch estimates support structures of lower lids</h3><p>Basically, we use the pinch test to see how good the lower lid elasticity is. If the elasticity is marginal, or not good, it is not an absolute contraindication to bleph. It will indicate that precautions should be taken to tighten the lower lid</p><p>These precautions could be a lid suspension, canthopexy, subconjunctival incision, etc. This is especially true in dry eyes. By the way, you may may want to consider getting silicone plugs put into your tear ducts to help keep the tears in the eyes</p><p><strong>Pinch blepharoplasty can be a useful tool</strong></p><p>The pinch blepharoplasty can be a very useful tool in the right patient in the correct setting. I typically perform a pinch blepharoplasty when performing a MACS-lift (minimal access cranial suspension). In this situation the cheek and malar structures are elevated by a suspension suture</p><p>Once this soft tissue has been placed in a superior direction the excess skin of the lower lid is then removed using a skin pinching technique. In a patient with good structural support of the lower eyelid and minimal excess or herniated fat a pinch blepharoplasty in Costa Rica may be beneficial to remove a very small amount of fat<br>

</div>In most blepharoplasty surgery skin excision is minimal less than 2 – 3 mm. It is the other structures of the eyelid that need to be supported. 
<p>Your issue is at the lid-cheek junction and tear trough area. Without seeing the whole mid face area (cheek bone) i would likely suggest 1</p><p>First laser the lower and upper lid skin going slightly on to the thicker cheek skin using a light to mild carbon dioxide laser to tighten the skin and then reappraising the response after 8 weeks</p><p>Then either nothing or a filler option fat transfer or Juvederm™.</p><p>Before you consider a blepharoplasty in Costa Rica, I would suggest you try using either a filler such as Juvaderm or Restylene or perhaps a fat transfer. It is not unusual to have hollows under the eyes at any age and these hollows often will respond very well to adding volume to these areas<br>

</div>I would suggest you start first with a filler which should last anywhere from 3 months to a year. While the bad news is that the filler will go away, the good news is if you do not like the look the fillers give you, it is not permanent
<p>If you decide you like the appearance of the fuller lower eyelids, then you can move to the next step, a fat transfer, which if successful, will last much longer. Please consult with a board certified plastic surgeon who can help you decide how to proceed</p><h4>Insurance Eyelid Surgery</h4><p>Eyelid surgery covered by insurance has much to do with your functional impairment when it comes to your superior and peripheral vision as well as your symptoms from having droopy lids. Insurance company requirements vary from state to state and from company to company but consult an eyelid specialist to see if you qualify!<br>

<i>Insurance Coverage for Upper Eyelid Blepharoplasty</i><p>Removal of excess upper eyelid skin (upper eyelid blepharoplasty) can be covered by insurance if the skin is interfering with your vision. Most insurances will require photographs, doctors notes and visual field tests which document improvement of your vision when the eyelids are elevated</p><p>Requirements can vary with each insurer and can change at any time. Most insurance companies now require that the superior field of vision be obstructed to at least 20 degrees or less for the blepharoplasty to be considered medically necessary</p><p>Some insurances do not cover <i>upper lid blepharoplasty in Costa Rica</i> at all regardless of whether your vision is affected or not, so you will have to check your particular insurance carrier to see if it is a covered benefit<br>

</div>If not, upper lid blepharoplasy can often be done under local anesthetic in the office and may be more affordable than you think. 
<p>Eyelid surgery won’t make bad scars or keloids. The eyelids are a privileged site for scars. In 28 years of soing eyelid surgery, I’ve never seen a bad scar. So getting your eyelids balanced in height is a real challlenge of the bottom eyelid surgery  you’re considering, you don’t have to worry about scars</p><p><em>Keloids unusual after eyelid surgery</em></p><p>Although there is a very slight risk of keloid formation, it would be extremely unusual to develop keloids after eyelid surgery. You should be able to safely proceed with your ptosis repair.<br>

<b>Lower lid puffiness</b><p>You appear to have lower lid puffiness due to herniated orbital fat fats which can be removed or repositioned, you also have a deep groove below the fat pads known as the tear trough which would also need to be addressed with fat repositioning or fat injection</p><p>I would be happy to see you for a consultation to further discuss, pricing varies and usually ranges from $2,000.00- $5,000.00.  </p><h5>Lower lid blepharoplasty</h5><p>You look like a candidate for a lower lid blepharoplasty to treat the herniated fat and loose skin…. </p><p>You herniation of your orbital fat pockets and skin laxity.  A lower eyelid blepharoplasty can greatly improve this, if good technique is used.  Make sure you specifically look at before and after pictures of real patients who have had this surgery performed by your surgeon and evaluate their results<br>

</div> The most important aspect is to find a surgeon you are comfortable with. I recommend that you seek consultation with a qualified board-certified plastic surgeon who can evaluate you in person. 
<p><b>Lower eyelid puffiness</b></p><p>The puffiness is caused by herniating fat that is bulging. I agree that this can be treated with lower eyelid blepharoplasty. I would do it through an incision inside the eyelid. Now, it appears you have what is called a “negative vector”</p><p>There are lots and lots of ways to treat this. Some are more effective than others. One sure-fire way of treating it is an orbital rim facial augmentation implant. Many plastic surgeons are not comfortable with this procedure and so recommend fat repositioning or cheek lift<br>

</div>Both are good options, and I perform them. But, when it is severe in your case, I would highly consider someone who does orbital implants for augmentation. You need something to support your lower eyelid long-term and only improving the bone structure underneath has longevity
<p>The fat repositioning and cheek lift have less longevity. </p><p>The photo is a bit grainy, but it does show the upper eyelid asymmetries. Unfortunately, it doesn’t show why. The possible reasons run from a quirky asymmetry in the amount of fat in the upper lids or asymmetrical upper lid infolding to the worst possible cause, which would be a tumor in the right upper eyelid/brow</p><p>A good exam and possible CT scans would be prudent. Performing an upper eyelid lift (blepharoplasty) should make those upper eyelids more symmetrical, though perfect symmetry is difficult to attain. There does appear to be a slight asymmetry in your eyebrows, but this is very common and is almost never noticed by anyone but you</p><p>Especially at your age, I doubt that you would find a brow lift to be worth the trouble, expense, and risk. Your lower lids are definitely lower than is considered “normal.” Generally, the lower lid edge should come up to or over the bottom of the iris (colored part of the eye) </p><p>The fact that yours are low at this early age, and both sides are pretty symmetrical points to it being something genetic – maybe it is a common trait in other members of your family? As long as your eyes close fully and are not dry or tearing frequently, they are probably functioning normally</p><p>On the other hand, if you don’t like this look, it is something that can be corrected surgically. As always, I would advise that you see an experienced surgeon, and get a thorough exam and consultation</p><h3>Eyelid Lift or Brow Lift?</h3><p>Almost all facial plastic surgeons will tell you that a brow lift (or forehead lift) is more invasive than an eyelid lift (blepharoplasty). The real question though is what procedure do you need for cosmetic facial enhancement? </p><p></p>

</div>If you are trying make a decision about the procedure, the should find out what you need. Each procedure has it’s own indications and limitations. 
<p>While endoscopic forehead lifting is a bigger surgery than upper blepharoplasty, it heals at about the same pace as the eyelid surgery. The most important issue is which bottom eyelid surgery to you need because they are absolutely not interchangeable</p><p>This is not really a matter of just choosing which surgery you want because it does not matter. Your best bet is to have an actual consultation. Based on that, your surgeon will be able to make a recommendation regarding the approach that is right for you</p><p><i>Lower blepharoplasty</i></p><p>If incisions are made from inside the eyelids, of cource they are not visible from out side. This type of incisions are usually used when only fat is removed without skin excision. In conventional blepharoplsty incisions are made below and very close to th lash lines, sometimes with extentions into laugh lines</p><p>They heal quite nicely and are well concealed. </p><p><em>Price list for blepharoplasty eye bags in 2009:</em></p><ul>
