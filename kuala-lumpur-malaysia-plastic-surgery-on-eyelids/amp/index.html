There are only a few options for the surgery technique. The best option is the one that you need based on your examination</p><p>From the photos, it does not appear that you have a lot of upper eyelid fat medially, so that part cat be skipped. Asymmetry is typically reduced by doing an asymmetrical amount of skin excision and setting the lid crease by removing a small strip of muscle</p><p>Fat excision is always done more conservatively now that in the past, as a youthful eyelid tends to be full and not hollow. I think you will get clarity from a consultation (or 2) and be able to make a nice informed choice for yourself</p><p><strong>Trans conjunctival or external blepharoplasty?</strong></p><p>If there is no excess skin Transcon junk title is the operation of choice. You appear to have some slight excess skin beginning to form so an external incision would give a better result for removal of the excess skin</p><p>Alternatively you could have a trance conjunctival blepharoplasty in Malaysia with a chemical or laser peel of your lower lids.</p><h4>Which type of blepharoplasty eyelid surgery</h4><p>No matter what you need to perform a fat transposition from ether of these approaches. Transconj – lower risk of issues and is usually combined with an external skin pinch or external skin pinch with muscle hitch or even canthopexy. Great approach for someone without much excess skinsubciliary- carries slightly more risk and is always combined with muscle hitch or canthopexy </p><p>This is able to tighten the lid much more for someone with significant skin laxity</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2430" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>It is my opinion that mid face lifts have probably hurt more people than helped them. The lower eyelid is a humbling area to work on with many well meaning surgeons going awry</p><p>The important thing here is to find a surgeon who makes sense to you. Don’t get hustled into more surgery than you need. Avoid surgeons who are cookie cutterish. Ask yourself if your consultation involved an examination</p><p>Did the surgeon actually touch and manipulate your face or was everything discussed over a desk. If you are not certain, that may be a sign that neither surgeon was your guy or gal.</p><p><strong>Lower Bleph with Midface Lift.</strong></p><p>It’s very difficult to give you an honest opinion without seeing your face. You can have both procedures at the same time or alone.

</div><p><b>Mid face lift</b></p><p>There is not one procedure that is applicable to all patients. The procedure needs to be customized to the individual patient. Without seeing pictures of you or examining you in person, it is impossible to give you specific or individualized advice</p><p>There are many different techniques for lifting the face, the mid face and addressing the lower eyelids.</p><h3>Mid-face lift and lower blepharoplasty</h3><p>I will offer a midface lift concomitantly with a lower blepharoplasty in Malaysia if the patient has significant malar descent in conjunction with steatoblepharon (fat pads) in the lower lid region. Not all patients with excess skin and bulging fat pads of the lower lids warrant a midface lift</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2432" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Part of the answer to your question depends on your aesthetic goals and the other on your particular anatomy. I will rarely perform a midface lift in isolation.</p><p><i>Approach to lower lid blepharoplasty</i></p><p>I prefer a transconjunctval approach to fatty lower lid bag conditions. An external approach involves cutting through skin and muscle which allows for adjustment of those structures when needed. There is more morbidity with the external approach with the trade off of more versatility when needed</p><p>You likely only need fat removal and/or fat repositioning which is best done , in my opinion, through a transconjunctval approach.</p><p><i>Lower eyelid approach</i></p><p>You would so fine with either approach. The reason for the differing opinions is that your lower eyelid skin appears to be at the beginning stages of excess…. Another option would be to undergo a transconjunctival approach with laser resurfacing of the lower eyelid skin to help tighten it</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2433" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The only extra potential issues with a subciliary approach is the possible scar and risk of ectropion, which is the reason for the differing opinions.</p><p><strong>Trans conjunctival vs subciliary approaches for lower eyelids. Who is right?</strong></p><p>I can appreciate your concern. Both methods are adequate for correction of the lower eyelids. My personal preference is to address the fat with the transconjunctival approach. This leaves the muscle intact, which decreases the risk of ectropion</p><p>I combine it with a sub-ciliary approach, because I can address better the excess skin excess. At the end what matters is the reputation of your surgeon and the results that they can achieve. The before and after pictures, are the best testimony to support the success with their technique</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2434" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Finally, make sure that they are board certified and that they specialize in eyelid surgery.</p><h4>Transconjunctival vs Subciliary Blepharoplasty in Malaysia</h4><p>Both surgical procedures would correct the bags. If the skin seems to be loose, you will need some removed. In that case, an external approach is best to remove skin at the same time</p><p>It is probably best to ask your surgeon if he is comfortable performing both techniques.</p><p><em>Blurred Vision Post-op Eyelid Surgery</em></p><p>The best advise is for you to immediately see a eye specialist. Like now! If something can be treated why wait?</p><p><strong>Better to wait to see if ptosis resolves</strong></p><p>In general it is best to wait several months to see if the ptosis is secondary to a structural change or post operative swelling. Very often the swelling can cause temprary ptosis which is self limited</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2435" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-39f8cba1dc7f4320b132af535d68c872">

</div><p>Take your time and get several opinions. There are many different options, both surgical and non-surgical.</p><p><strong>If it were me, I would choose plastic eye surgery.</strong></p><p>The transconjuctival removal of fat will permanently fix your problem. The use of injectable fillers sounds easy but sometimes can give a “ground glass” appearance to the tissues lying just superficial to them. Fillers are not permanent but, in the upper cheek/lower eyelid they tend to stay around for much longer than elsewhere (1-2 years)</p><p><b>Fillers can help</b></p><p>Although removal of fat via a blepharoplasty in Malaysia is an option in some patients, in your case, it would not be prudent. Your degree of prolapse is mild. Fillers [Juviderm or Restylane] will improve the appearance as it will blend the eyelid to cheek transition</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2439" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>But on close inspection of the photo you provided, it seems to me that hyperpigmentation of the eyelid skin is also a major contributing factor.

<li>Physical findings noted on the surgeon’s examination (upper lid skin crowding the lashes or overhanging the margin</li>
<li>Visual field testing showing the blockage of peripheral vision</li>

</div><p><em>Insurance for eyelid surgery</em></p><p>Upper eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty) may be covered by insurance if it can be proven to be causing visual field impairment. This must be documented by an ophthalmologist (eye doctor) and then submitted to your carrier</p><p>However, this procedure is typically denied by most insurance carriers as they deem eyelid surgery to be cosmetic.</p><h4>Lower eyelid puffiness</h4><p>Eyelid puffiness can be caused by many factors including inflammation, trauma, or excessive fat. Although your first approach in using dermal fillers was a good one and didn’t work, I recommend a transconjunctival blepharoplasty now</p><p>It will resolve the problem with minimal time.</p><p><i>Bleph or brow lift</i></p><p>A bit more history and a good physical exam would be helpful,. Photos are very difficult to use to make an assessment. The angle of the photos alone can distort the appearance.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2442" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>You will benefit from lower lid blepharoplasty with fat re-drapping and fat grafting to mid face area to obtain harmony and volume in your peri-orbital area. Please, seek out a board certified plastic surgeon in your area for consultation</p><h5>Lower blepharoplasty</h5><p>I see that you have a prominent lower lateral orbital fat pad in addition to a prominent tear trough groove and hollow. I recommend beginning with removal of the excess fat with lower blepharoplasty, and a couple months after the cosmetic surgery eye lift placing a hyaluronic acid filler like Restylane (about 0</p><p>5-0.8 cc) in your tear trough. I do not recommend having the filler prior to the blepharoplasty, because filler can mask the fat pad and make it challenging for the physician to see it when needed during cosmetic surgery eye lift</p><p>In addition, during lower blepharoplasty the tear trough and under eye hollow gets pressed and manipulated which could affect filler nearby. I warn patients on which I perform laser (no scalpel, less bruising) lower blepharoplasty that they will need to follow up for filler later</p><h4>Lower Eyelid Bag</h4><p>It looks like lower eyelid surgery may help, but it’s hard to plan anything through a one-sided photo. Another non-surgical option may be to inject filler into the tear trough between the eyelids and cheek</p><p>The best options for filler would be restylane or juvederm. I would recommend a comprehensive consultation with an oculoplastic or facial plastic surgeon to discuss your condition.</p><p><strong>Bag under left eye. Would a lower blepharoplasty help? </strong></p><p>Your left eye appears deep set. You also have a bit of soft tissue atrophy (volume loss) around the lower lid cheek junction (tear trough) and cheeks. Removal of fat from the lower eyelid would flatten out the lower eyelid “bag”</p><p>But, you may want to consider adding volume through fillers or fat to the cheeks and tear trough area to rejuvenate the appearance of both the lower lids and cheeks. Consult with your local plastic surgeons to determine the treatment options for you</p><h3>More Invasive Surgery Increase Chance of Bruising</h3><p>A bruise is secondary to a collection of blood underneath the skin. Every step you take you take in surgery can cause bruising. The more steps you take, the more chances there are to create a bruise</p><p>That being said, bruising from a upper blepharoplasty is relatively minor and resolves overtime. The most important step is to choose the right surgeon and have the proper procedure.</p><h5>Prices for surgery in 2011:</h5><ul>
