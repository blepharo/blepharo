In many cases, I combine less invasive treatment, like laser, with injectable fillers to achieve safe, fast, effective solutions to enhance the appearance of the eyes</p><p>It is very important to discuss your goals and desires with your plastic surgeon to make sure everyone is thinking the same thing- How long will the result last? What is the recovery time? What is the cost of the different options? Keep these simple things in mind to make your informed decision</p><p><strong>Laser vs. cautery vs. scalpel for blepharoplasty</strong></p><p>There have been many articles published on which is superior for blepharoplasty in Syracuse, and most have shown no difference at 2-3 weeks post-op.</p><p>Laser and cautery can cause slightly more swelling, but less bruising in my experience</p><p>I prefer electric cautery for its low expense, but improved hemostasis.

</div><h4>How can I decide which surgeons are using the most advanced techniques of Syracuse lower eyelid blepharoplasty surgery for eye bags?</h4><p>As always an in-office examination of your lower eyelid area is required to determine if a lower blepharoplasty in Syracuse is the best treatment for you. With respect to the most advanced technique for lower blepharoplasty, I believe in the hands of qualified surgeons, the fat repositioning technique is the most advanced, most consistent, and the most anatomically correct technique because it reduces the prominence of eyelid bags while simultaneously counters the effects of peri-orbital aging</p><p>Fat repositioning relies on preserving and improving your lower eyelid area, whereas fat subtractive (removing the fat bag) can lead to hollowing and an older, less healthy appearance.

</div><p><i>Lower Eyelid rejuvenation</i></p><p>I do see your concern and it looks like you do have some prolapsed fat in your lower eyelid. Typically the best way to address this is with a blepharoplasty. However you are very young, and surgery may carry unnecessary risks</p><p>I would recommend starting with fillers to the lower eyelid and seeing you like it. This technique has much lower risks and patients are very happy with results.</p><p><em>Eyelid bags</em></p><p>You could really go either way here. You have some prolapsed fat, and also a deep tear trough. The easiest way is to use some fillers to help add volume to the tear trough and make the area appear smoother</p><p>Make sure you go to an experienced injector since this is a more difficult area to fill. The longer term option is to do a fat repositioning blepharoplasty where the fat is moved down into the tear trough</p><p>Don’t have the fat excised or you will be more hollow with darker circles.</p><p><strong>Sounds like a sagging lateral eyebrow.</strong></p><p>There is no substitute for a personal consultation. I would recommend not falling in love with the first surgeon you meet. See several surgeon which will help you understand that there is more than one way to do things</p><p>The anesthesia is often dictated by precisely what surgery you need. Eyelid surgery on a healthy person can be preformed in an office procedure room under straight local. Light sedation makes people much less tense and more comfortable with surgery</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2518" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>This type twilight sedation needs to be performed in an accredited operating room. Deeper sedation is generally need for a forehead lift. I would be more concerned with what is the right approach for you, and who will do your surgery, rather than the dollar cost</p><p>This is your face we are talking about and not every facial and eyelid surgeon is created equal. Remember that there are generally three fees you need to consider: surgeons fee, facility fee, and the cost of the anesthesiologist</p><p><i>Bags under eyes</i></p><p>You have fullness under the lids due to fat in this location; typically this manifests in older age groups. Your best option is a lower blepharoplasty with fat repositioning.

</div><p>Find a surgeon who can do this procedure from the inside of the eyelids. This leaves no external scar and also prevents complications after lower lid surgery that are commoner with external approaches. Not many surgeons do this procedure through the inside of the eyelid (transconjunctival), and the ones that do so often remove the fat instead of repositioning it</p><p>Removing the fat (as opposed to repositioning) will correct the problem but create hollowness that is equally unattractive.</p><p><i>Fat Transposition in Lower Eyelid Lift</i></p><p>Many plastic surgeons will remove the fat pockets from the lower eyelid region during an eyelid lift.

</div><p>I think this is the procedure that you heard has a relatively low success rate — and the reason is that fat grafts from the abdomen don’t have an attached blood supply, and a lot of the fat doesn’t survive</p><p>A better operation, in my opinion, is a fat transposition lower eyelid lift. During this procedure, I use the fat that is around the eye to fill in the hollow area between the eyelid and the cheek</p><p>This graft always survives because it remains attached to its blood supply. This technique can be performed with a skin incision, if there is excess skin that needs to be removed, or without a skin incision (transconjunctival, from the inside of the eyelid) if no extra skin is present</p><p><i>My under eyes are hollow… What can I do?</i></p><p>Difficult to know without a exam, but it seems that you could have had too much fat removed from your lower lids, filler done in the office is a very effective and long lasting solution</p><h3>Fillers are far more flexible than grafted fat.</h3><p>The fillers will last about 1 year and this is a very viable approach to getting help for the lower eyelid space. Often this is also a very good alternative to having fat removed.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2517" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

See an oculoplastic specialist for evaluation.</p><h3>Ask about eyelid muscles</h3><p>The most important question is whether the surgeon you choose can do your surgery without cutting through the orbicularis muscles in the lower eyelid.

With a blepharoplasty you will look rejuvenated.</p><p><strong>Upper Eyelid Hooding in an Asian eyelid</strong></p><p>For full upper eyelids, the best treatment is a blepharoplasty in Syracuse in which skin and the appropriate amount of fat is removed. In patients of asian descent, it is very important to remove less fat than would be removed for many non asian descent patients</p><p>As a general rule, asian eyelid tend to look best with a little more fullness. The second issue is that you should have a technique called a supra-tarsal fixation as part of the procedure.

</div><p>I have performed eyelid surgery for over 20 years and it’s not really painful. Patients typically feel some dull procedure.</p><p><strong>Eyelid pain</strong></p><p>pain after blepheroplasty is mild. Some patients will feel a dull ache behind the eye over the first 24 hours but, ice helps with the pain and swelling</p><p><b>Selecting the appropriate surgeon</b></p><p>If you’re considering eyelid surgery, I would not really focus on the most advanced techniques. I would focus on selecting a certain with great training and reproducible excellent results.</p><h3>11 days postop after bleph</h3><p>This sounds like normal postoperative findings following eyelid surgery – there will be quite a bit of swelling and tightness. This will improve over time – in some over weeks and sometimes even months.</p><p><i>Eyelid surgery – early postop changes</i></p><p>It sounds like you have some postoperative swelling, which is not uncommon at 11 days out. This will make the eyes look puffy, thick, and may make the shape a little unusual. As the swelling goes away (over the next few weeks), that should settle down</p><p>After blepharoplasty, it make look a little “surgical” for the 2-3 months, as things settle in. After that, usually the results look quite good. Speak to your surgeon about your concerns, and make sure there isn’t anything abnormal going on</p><p>You may wish to try some eyelid massage techniques, as well. He/she can instruct you on those.</p><h3>Syracuse blepharoplasty causes swelling…wait to judge result.</h3><p>At 11 days days post-op, the end result of as blepharoplasty cannot be asessed.

</div><p>Best to share your concerns with your eyelid surgeon. It does take some time for eyelids to recover after blepharoplasty. With time your eyelids should return to “normal”.</p><p><i>Will my Insurance Pay for Blepharoplasty?</i></p><p>Upper eyelid Blepharoplasty is covered by insurance if you can document decreased vision because of the excess eyelid skin. The surgeon needs to document this with photos and visual fields. Often preauthorization from the insurance company is necessary</p><p>If there is no visual loss, insurances will not pay.</p><h4>Flying is a bad idea</h4><p>There are several reasons why flying immediately after plastic surgery on eyelids is a bad idea</p><ol>
<li>If you sustain a bleed behind your eye, which the risk is highest in the first 24-48 hours after bottom eyelid surgery, you will be in flight on a plane. There is a risk with a bleed of losing permanent vision. It is a huge risk to take.</li>
<li>On the flight there is a lot of getting up and down, moving around, lifting baggage if needed..all bad things after eye surgery. These in itself increase the risk of a bleed post eye surgery</li>
<li>If a stitch breaks you will be midflight and then what are you going to do? catch a flight immediately back when you get home? Call around for a surgeon to fix the broken stitch All in all, you should be around for 24 hours minimum after eyelid surgery</li>
