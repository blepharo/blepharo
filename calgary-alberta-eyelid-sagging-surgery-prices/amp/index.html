Calgary blepharoplasty procedures can be very rewarding, if done correctly.</p><p><strong>Blepharoplasty Complications</strong></p><p>It would be possible to list the various possible complications to blepharoplasty; in my opinion, though, this is a very important question that should be posed to your surgeon.</p><p>Select a surgeon whom you feel comfortable with; one who answers all your questions to your satisfaction and it able to display multiple before and after photos of patients with similar concerns</p><h3>Are You Awake During Blepharoplasty Surgery?</h3><p>There a three options for anesthesia if doing “both” upper and lower lids. </p><p>1st Local only can be done. Much easier if only for upper lids, but can do lowers but very hard with a patient who might be anxious</p><p>2.

</div><h3>Swelling After Blepharoplasty</h3><p>It is not uncommon to have swelling in your upper eyelids for 4-6 weeks or longer depending on how much other work was done including fat and muscle removal. The swelling will subside over time</p><p>The key is operative precision, adequate hemostatis, and shaping of the eyelid including placement of the eyelid incision to maximize the shape and contour long term. </p><h5>Upper Eyelid Swelling 1 Week After Blepharoplasty, Normal?</h5><p>Your case is a bit different as you addressed only one side.

</div>Our office has our face/eyes/neck lift patients sleep with their head elevated for at least a week. We find that this, along with ice, helps. Make sure you check with your Plastic Surgeon
<p><strong>Fillers Work for Tear Troughs, Hollows, Bags, and Dark Circles</strong></p><p>Tear troughs are dark, indented lines that course between the lower lid and the upper cheek. In youth, no significant separation is typically noticeable there. However, with the passage of time, resulting from the shrinkage of the cheek fat pad and its slippage downward, most people begin to notice the appearance of tear troughs by their late thirties and forties</p><p>Age thirty is a bit young and an inherited tendency may be a factor in this particular instance. Like a balloon that has been deflated, the area under the eyes tends to crinkle and billow in small bags and because the skin is so relatively thin, it begins to reflect the dark blood vessels and muscles below<br>
</p>

</div>The result in extreme cases: tear trough lines, hollows, dark circles, crinkles and tiny bags. 
<p>Fortunately, nowadays, we have a whole variety of filling agents that can be instilled in small amounts in this region to raise the area and smooth it</p><p>Juvederm – UltraXC is my particular favorite for the job. By restoring the volume lost to the area, tear troughs can be softened, and darkness, crinkles and bagginess improved significantly in a matter of minutes: usually five minutes per eye, and the results are immediate</p><p><i>Filling the Tear Trough</i></p><p>Lower eyelids should really just look like an extension of the upper cheek. To accomplish this we need to get rid of the deep groove under the eye or the “tear-trough”. Filling the tear-trough can be a challenge<br>

</div>Fat repositioning and arcus release are affective but limited, especially for the more severe cases. I frequently use an implant in conjunction with fat repostioning and arcus release. This is done through the inside of the eyelid and there is almost never any need to remove skin
<p>If skin quality is a problem it should be treated with laser resurfacing. Skin removal is typically not effective and has a high complication rate. </p><p>For mild cases a “lunchtime” Juvederm or Restylane procedure is very effective and avoids surgery</p><p>Fat injections are great when they work. Unfortunately this is not very often and as such I suggest not trying. </p><p><i>Ptosis repair is not part of upper blepharoplasty in Calgary</i><br>

</div>Ptosis repair is not part of upper Blepharoplasty. Ptosis repair can be done as a stand alone procedure as can Blepharoplasty in Calgary. In many cases the two surgeries can be combined either for medical or cosmetic reasons or both
<p>The issue of what insurance pays or does not pay varies much from region to region. Typically though if more than one procedure is done the documentation will reflect this. </p><p>Ptosis surgery is where the upper eyelid elevating muscle is tightened to lift the height of the lid (distance of lid margin where lashes are to the pupil). It truly opens the eyes. This can be a cosmetic or functional surgery depending on degree of lid droop<br>

</div>This is more complex than standard blepharoplasty surgery in which skin and fat are addressed (reduced). 
<p>A poor outcome to ptosis surgery can be a lifelong problem so make sure to see an experienced ptosis surgeon for this</p><p>By and large these are oculoplastic surgeons only. </p><h5>Ptosis Surgery and bleph</h5><p>Ptosis repair is a separate surgery from blepharoplasty in Calgary but can typically be done at the same time as blepharoplasty. Ptosis surgery may be coverable by insurance. </p><p><em>Ptosis and blepharoplasty are distinct procedural elements.</em></p><p>You are running into these issues because you are asking your potential surgeons to have your health insurance pay for the eyelid surgery. Billing health insurance is encumbered by a lot of rules which may or may not make sense to you<br>

</div>You look at your eyelid and only see it as a single problem. That is not how surgeons and insurance companies think. 
<p>Ptosis surgery and blepharoplasty in Calgary are distinct and are billed accordingly. </p><p>Also in an effort to control costs, some insurance companies have rules requiring these procedures to be bundled essentially meaning that one of the procedures will be paid if both procedures are performed at the same time</p><p>The insurance payment for these procedures is very small so most surgeons are now unwilling to accept this type of insurance company discounting. This has lead to a very inconvenient situation where some surgeons will only repair these closely related but distinct problems in separate surgeries<br>

<p><b>No, you do not need lower blepharoplasty at this time.</b></p><p>In the photo, you are looking up with your chin down. Doing this, you demonstrate really no herniated orbital fat. This is what lower blepharoplasty addresses. You will get nothing from a lower blepharoplasty. What you need in lower eyelid volume in the form of Restylane</p><p>The challenge is finding a filler who can expertly sculpt your lower eyelid contour. Treatment for you should last well over a year. </p><p><i>Consider non-surgical options first</i></p><p> The fullness in your lower lids will always be exaggerated when you look up. If you look down you’ll see improvement in this area. Try this in front of a mirror: slowly nod your head up and down with your eyes fixed on your reflection</p><p>You will notice that the shadows under your eyes look better when your head’s tilted back (up nod) and your eyes are rotated down. The “bag” looks more prominent when you look up with a downward head tilt (down nod)</p><p>Look closely and you will see that your head is tilted down and you’re looking up in the photograph you have posted. Why does this occur? The separation of the fat compartments of your eyelid and cheek create a small indentation or depression which creates a shadow under your eyelid<br>

</div>When you look up, the eyelid fat is pushed forward. When you look down the fat enters the eye socket and no longer produces the “bag.” Since you have youthful skin with tight, healthy lids, surgery would not be the recommended first option
<p>Instead, consider trying facial fillers first. Fillers can fill in the indentation and create a smoother contour from your lid to your cheek. This will help your area of concern, remove the shadow, and camouflage the swelling you see when crying</p><p>The choice of fillers would best be determined by discussing your situation with a cosmetic provider with experience injecting this “tear trough” area. </p><p><strong>Is blepharoplasty the best option for my under eye bags?</strong></p><p>It may be that your photos are not very good, but it doesn’t appear that you have under eye bags. It actually appears as though you have dark circles and hollowness which would benefit from a filler</p><h3>How to correct a tear trough deformity</h3><p>A transconjuctival blepharoplasty with fat in Calgary repositioning or fat injection along with a release of the arcus marginalia is the best approach for your particular anatomy and concerns. Transconjuctival blepharoplasty has a lower incidence of abnormal scarring that can pull your lower lid than the open transcutaneous blepharoplasty</p><p>To learn more, please visit the link below or consult with a board certified plastic surgeon. </p><p><i>Lower blepharoplasty with fat repositioning</i><br>

</div>The photo you included is not ideal, but you appear to be a candidate for a lower bleph with fat repositioning. I believe that if you just have a traditional bleph that will only reduce the fat, you are being set up for a hollowed appearance
<p>Fat repositioning will reposition the fat to allow for a much smoother transition between your lower lid and the upper cheek. It should make the tear trough much more shallower.</p><p>Once you’ve healed from the under eye blepharoplasty, you can then assess to see if you need some filers or even future fat transfer; all depends on the result and your anatomy</p><p><i>Uneven eyelids after contact lens wear on one side</i></p><p>Ptosis or drooping of eyelids can be caused by multiple factors. These can include weakening or stretching of the muscles which elevate your eyelid, nerve damage to the nerve which stimulates those muscles, mechanical which something weighs down your eyelid, or inflammation from an infection or foreign body</p><p>You mention wear of a contact lens of the side not affected. Why the use of a contact lens on one side? If you are using your right eye mostly to see, then with inattention the left upper lid may drop</p><p>Other causes can include neuromuscular diseases such as myasthenia gravis. The simple answer is I doubt your contact lens wear caused your droopy eyelid byt evaluation by an oculoplastic surgeon is warranted. </p><p><b>Fix my droopy eyes</b></p><p>Eyelid ptosis or droopy eyelids has many causes. There are multiple surgical procedures to correct droopy eyelids. Depending on the cause of your eyelid droop your treatment plan will need to be individualized. to learn more about different options for eyelid droop correction Google oculoplastic surgery and you should be able to find an expert that can fix this type of problem</p><p><i>Fillers versus blepharoplasty for treating the tear trough</i></p><p></p>

</div>You should definitely have fillers performed. I suggest trying a hyaluronic acid based filler such as Juvederm first. Stay far away from permanent and semipermanent fillers as there is a host of long term complications that you want to avoid
<p>If you are pleased with the results I would suggest converting to fat grafting which can be permanent. Fillers will do a better job with the tear trough then a blepharoplasty in Calgary in your face because your zygome is at what we call a ‘negative vector’</p><p>That is it projects less than your eye. If the bit of scleral show (whiteness below your iris) and the bowing of your lower lid really bothers you, a canthopexy will correct this without a formal blepharoplasty</p><p><i>Lower Lid Blepharoplasty or fillers for “Tear Trough.”</i></p><p>What I see in your pictures looks like “fat herniation.” If it is, then either procedure would be appropriate. Fillers are fast, easy and relatively inexpensive, but only temporary. Under eye blepharoplasty is permanent when done properly, but more expensive and has some down time</p><p>If choosing eyelid fat removal, do not allow anyone to simply remove the protuberant fat, as you will need it in the future. </p><p><strong>Blepharoplasty +/- Browlift?</strong></p><p>My recommendation to you would be to consider a conservative upper blepharoplasty in Calgary. I would suggest taking a small amount of skin to prevent hollowing the eyes. You want to maintain the volume and contour of the upper eyelid area while reducing the hooding to reduce the heaviness</p><p>I do not think you need a browlift. The brow position looks appropriate and would not be worth the extra surgery. Make sure to find an experience surgeon in your area that can deliver a natural result for you </p><p><em>Cold versus Warm Compresses</em></p><p></p>

</div>Cool compresses may be a very soothing feeling for the patient however we do not recommend it. We cannot risk the chance of the possibility of having frostbite because the skin will be numb after you administer it
<p>Doing hot or cold compress in the early stages after the eyelid fat removal have no bearing whatsoever for the fast recovery or in the healing process for that matter. </p><p><i>How much does surgery cost in 2012:</i></p><ul>
