Fillers and Botox may be used to modify this area somewhat but it is temporary. </p><h4>Correction of Hooded Eyelids</h4><p>The correction of hooded eyelids requires evaluation. In most cases, it will require skin resection and fat removal, only if needed. </p><h5>A trans conjunctival blephroplasty would be a great option for correcting your lower eye lid bulges</h5><p>While you are quite young your photos reveal that you have pseudoptosis of the fat in your lower lids. This is what is causing the bulges and the shadows. </p><p>A relatively easy way to correct this is to make an incision inside the lower eye lid and remove the extra fat</p><p>This can be done safely and give you a permante correction. As to see photos of your plastic surgeons results before scheduling. </p><p>At 27, I would recommend fillers to the tear trough and the under eye rim and the cheek bone. </p><p>The early loss of bone volume in the under eye area is the primary problem. ‘building’ this up would support the lower eyelid and improve overall appearance</p><p>Seek out an experienced injector who is capable of helping you achieve your goals. </p><p>Eyelid uplift would be a second option if the non surgical options under delivers</p><h3>Outpatient eyelid surgery </h3><p>In general eyelid surgery is done in the out patient setting in an accredited surgical center. </p><p>These procedures generally run from 2500 to 7500 depending upon individual and surgeon characteristics, ideals and goals. In some situations a change to the shape of the eyes can be created through changing the lateral canthal position – the tilt of the eyelid fissure on the side away from the nose<br>

</div>Other options may include adding some volume to the anterior maxilla or cheek region or a Facelift/brow-lift and laser resurfacing. Procedures always have risks and are often discussed after the consultation with a physician
<p>Risks and benefits are very individualized and in general those that complete a cosmetic surgery are excited about the change and would do it again as many go on to enhance other features too. When one is ready they tend to know it</p><h5>Yes, eyelid surgery is an outpatient procedure</h5><p>This is one of the most common procedures performed by facial plastic surgeons. Without photos, it’s difficult to assess your eyebrows and eyelids and make a suggestion. But regardless, these procedures are performed as outpatient procedures</p><p>Costs would depend on what is recommended to you at your initial consultation. </p><p><b>Repositioning is a good idea</b></p><p>For years, surgeons would perform lower eyelid blepharoplasty in India with the intent of removing bulges. However, a better concept is to create a smooth transition fro the lower eyelid to the cheeks. Therefore, in some patients, fat repositioning is not only possible but required<br>

</div>This will give a more natural, youthful look without abnormal hollowness. 
<p>If folds are due to volume loss, then injectable fillers can be used. If it is due to underlying muscle action, then botox can be used</p><p>If they are due to poor skin elasticity, then skin resurfacing with chemical peel or laser can be used. These are all nonsurgical options. </p><p><em>Lower Eyelid Fillers</em></p><p>From your description. a filler would be very reasonable. I use both Juvederm and Radiesse very successfully for this area. The problem with the “thin skin” in this area is that anything done must be placed deep, just above the bony orbital rim to prevent the filler being visible</p><p>I also do the injection with a very small blunt needle to reduce bruising and improve safety. </p><p><strong>Blepharoplasty or Eyelid Lift</strong></p><p>The puffiness is caused by bulging fat in the lower lids and descent or loss of cheek volume around the eyes.  You have more prominent or what doctor’s call “negative vector” eyes.  It is important that the orbital rim (area below the bulge) is treated with either repositioning the bulging fat or fat grafting<br>

</div>  A midface or cheek lift may also help this area.  There are a number of options but the best option is determined by an in person consultation. 
<h3>You need fillers in your tear troughs</h3><p>Just a little filler can help you greatly. If someone knows how to inject yuor lower eyelids, they can really help you. They need to use cannula and not needle. </p><p><em>Depends on where the stitches are</em></p><p>How long eyelid stitches should remain depend on location of the stitches. I generally remove upper eyelid sutures in three to five days and lower eyelid sutures in five to seven days. If the stitches are in the upper eyelid and they came out after one or two days, generally that is not a problem</p><p>It sounds like that you have had no problems with the stitches coming out after two days. I would not worry about it.<br>

</div><h3>Blepharoplasty with local anesthesia</h3><p>An upper lid blepharoplasty in India could be done with either of the anesthesia types that you mentioned (IV sedation and local anesthesia versus oral medication and local anesthesia). The ultimate decision would be yours. As long as your surgeon is comfortable performing the procedure with oral medication and local anesthesia, I would say that should be fine and should not compromise your outcome</p><p>There should also be no difference as far as safety with either choice. The main difference will be in comfort. People are very different in terms of pain tolerance, so it’s difficult to know what yours is</p><p>When having the procedure with only oral medication and local anesthesia, the only real pain should be when the local anesthesia is injected. Once this is done, the area should be numbed and you should not be able to feel anything else<br>

<b>Choosing an Eyelid Surgeon</b><p>It’s not just the credentials (Oculoplastic, Facial Plastic, and General Plastic Surgeons are all board certified for eyelid surgery). You should look for 4 things when finding your surgeon. </p><p>1. A lot of experience with upper eyelid surgery<br>
2. Someone you are comfortable with<br>
3. Results you like (look at photos)<br>
4. Happy Patients (ask to talk to some of their patients) </p><p><strong>Who is best to perform upper and lower blepharoplasty</strong></p><p>In short, if you are pleased with the results you have seen and you trust this doctor, you should feel comfortable proceeding with your surgery. If you have questions, it can never hurt to talk to another doctor that might come highly recommended as well<br>

</div>Facial plastic surgeons, oculoplastic surgeons, and plastic surgeons are all typically trained in these procedures, particularly if they are board certified, but there are varying degrees of experience once in practice; some focus on largely body work and do very little facial work, and some do very little cosmetic work
<p>We perform almost exclusively cosmetic facial surgery and we feel that allows a greater attention to facial details, including the eyelids. As an example, we are careful to avoid an incision that places you at risk for lowering/drooping the lower eyelid and giving “scleral show” or white show below the colored part of your eye</p><p>We also take great care to balance the eyes with the cheek and brow regions, so our patients achieve the most harmonious result possible–many times this involves precise, small additions of volume to brow and upper cheek areas<br>

</div>I have had volume restoration myself to the tear trough/upper cheek area and feel it made a significant improvement, as do others. Many of the patients in the link below had eyelid surgery with volume restoration
<p>This is elective surgery and there is no rush to proceed until you are completely comfortable.</p><h4>Best type of surgeon to perform upper/lower blepharoplasty</h4><p>Facial plastic surgeons, plastic surgeons, and oculoplastic surgeons are all well qualified to perform upper and lower blepharoplasty. If you have a rapport with your surgeon and they have nice results, you should not get hung up on the subspecialty</p><p><b>Hyaluronic Acid Fillers A Great For Tear Troughs </b><br>
</p>

</div>The hollowness in your tear troughs can be treated with hyaluronic acid fillers. I would suggest either Restylane or Restylane Silk. In very skilled hands Voluma is also an option. The advantage of these fillers is that they tend to do well under the eyes in terms of not causing swelling in most people (Restylane Silk sometimes swells a lot during the first few days, but that usually resolves quickly)
<p>Fillers in this area last a long time (generally more than a year-and often much longer than that). However they also have the advantage of being able to be safely dissolved if for some reason you are unhappy with the result</p><p>This is an advanced treatment area. The key step in success is picking a cosmetic physician who has experience and is skilled in treating this area. </p><p> I would consider doing a “SOOF lift blepharoplasty”. I have been using this technique for over 15 years with very good success in patients similar to you</p><p>Do some Internet research on this approach to educate yourself. Always see an experienced facial plastic specialist and make sure they are familiar with this approach as many are not. </p><p><em>Stitches out after two days</em></p><p>As long as the incision is closed you should be fine. Eyelid incision wounds heal amazingly well. </p><h4>Check with your surgeon and don’t rub your eyes</h4><p></p>

</div>As long as the incision line is intact you are fine. But it is fragile and you could rub it apart accidentally so be sure to leave the area absolutely alone and go have your doctor check you
<h4>Transconjunctival or Transcutaneous Blepharoplasty?</h4><p>I favor Transconjunctival because there is less risk of ectropion or change in eyelid shape. You have excellent skin and do not need skin removal. The main reason to do Transcutaneous is when skin removal needed</p><p>Dryness after upper eyelid blepharoplasty can be due to several causes. Most commonly, dry eye is the result of the eyelids not fully closing allowing for exposure and drying of the outer surface of your eye (the cornea)<br>

</div>This condition is usually treated with lubricating drops and gel. In some cases tear duct plugs are placed to slow down the drainage of tears from your eye. This allows your natural tears to moisturize your eyes
<p>Drying of your cornea can persist and distort your vision. Another explanation may be associated with a change in your contact lens or eyeglass prescription after eyelid uplift. Finally thick lubricating drops or gels can distort your vision</p><p>I would strongly recommend a throrough evaluation by an ophthalmologist to be assured other issues are not present that can result in visual compromise. </p><h4>Visual changes three weeks following blepharoplasty is abnormal.</h4><p>There are numerous potential causes of altered vision following eye lid tuck – blepharoplasty. Please see a board certified opthalmologist and continue your follow-up with your treating surgeon. Your vision is too precious to take chances. Blurry visual changes three weeks following a blepharoplasty is abnormal!<br>

</div><h5>Upper eyelid</h5><p>By all means you might have either a hereditary or aquired condition that lends itself very well to either brow repositioning or upper eyelid surgery or a combination of both. Either procedure is minimally invasive, painless, with a quick recovery</p><p>Make sure you consult with an expert so that they can make an appropriate diagnosis. ! </p><p><i>I wouldn’t do either; Consider Botox</i></p><p>I agree that you have well positioned brows with a slight lateral arch. I also agree that you have minimal skin excess in the setting of having prominent eyes. I think in 5-10 years, you may make a more convincing case for eyelid procedure</p><p>However, at this time, I would be hard pressed to suggest a surgical procedure when other options exist. For a patient of your age with your physical findings, I would suggest a slight lateral chemical brow lift using Botox<br>

<em>Upper eyelid surgery or browlift</em><p>I think your brows are fine. Browlifts are overdone in my opinion. Looking at your eyes, you may have a touch of upper lid retraction which means that your upper lid margin hangs out at the top of the cornea or above it</p><p>Normally it should be a touch below. This may be an early sign of Graves’ disease. I recommend that you consult with an Ophthalmic Plastic Surgeon to sort it all out. Not knowing anything else about you, I would do a blepharoplasty alone or with an upper lid retraction repair to lower the lid just a tad to avoid the bug eye appearance<br>

</div><h3>The Safest Procedure for Upper and Lower Eyelid Hollowness?</h3><p>Hollow eyelids can be a difficult problem for many people, but injection of fat can be a great solution. Fat injection is carried out by first removing some fat using liposuction, then processing the fat, and then injecting it to the necessary areas around the eyes</p><p>The fat transfers are done in small sessions so you can build up to your desired look. Be sure to consult with a board certified facial plastic or plastic surgeon when considering this procedure. </p><h5>Steristrips and upper eyelid surgery</h5><p>The real answer should come from your own doctor. However, steristrips are often used in place of sutures or to support the incisional healing after the sutures have been removed. Every surgeon operates a bit differently. You should contact your surgeon to ask him about the steri-strips.<br>

<i>Blepharoplasty and dry eyes</i><p><b>Blepharoplasty in India</b> can affect dry eyes, so this is something you need to discuss in details with your surgeon. If too much skin is removed on the top, you might not be able to close your eyes, making them even drier, leading to exposure keratitis, and potentially more problems</p><p>Similarly, if too much skin or muscle are removed on the bottom without proper realignment and suspension techniques, your eyes appearance and health might be adversely affected. </p><p>Oculoplastic surgeons are usually well trained and qualified to deal with patients with dry eyes and can advise you on how to proceed</p><p>Alternatively experienced facial plastic surgeons and general plastic surgeons may be a good resource for you as well. They will usually refer you to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation and necessary treatment for dry eyes prior to bags under eyes surgery<br>

</div> Your lower lids show excess fat in the different compartments of the lower lid. I think you have very minimal excess skin but rather you have laxity in the orbicularis muscle that goes around the eye over the fat
<p>I think that you would be a good candidate for a trans-conjunctival removal of the fat, a pinch skin excision and plication/canthoplasty to tighten the muscle. Your skin color has no bearing on what operation we do on you or the degree of difficulty</p><p>Look for a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon to consult with on the pros and cons, risk and benefit and recovery associated with the procedure. </p><h4>Which would you recommend; Upper Blepharoplasty or Forehead Lift? </h4><p>In my opinion, you have both extra skin on the upper eyes and low eyebrows. You need to be evaluated in person or by Skype so the surgeon may see the movement of both the eyelids and the forehead</p><p></p>

</div>The basic purpose of the blephroplasty is to remove the skin; the browlift is to lift the brows. 
<p>Sometimes this is a tough decision to make even in an in-person consultation because there are a lot of variables to consider: amount of excess eyelid skin, degree of brow droop, and often subtle, unrecognized eyelid droop which causes patients to subconsciously raise their eyebrows</p><p>Finally, the patients aesthetic desires will be final deciding factor. I know excellent surgeons who aesthetically appreciate a very high arching brow, while others do not. Its important for your surgeon to assess all the variables, and then the two of you decide which approach is the right one for you</p><p>Browlifts also come in a variety of different techniques, which depending on your hairline and hair density, maybe not be the right choice for you. There may not be a “right or wrong” choice here, but rather what’s most appropriate for you</p><h3>Forehead lift vs upper blepharoplasty?</h3><p>You will have a much better and more natural and youthful result with a forehead lift. If just the skin is removed with an upper blepharoplasty you will still look old, tired and sad – which is why I had a forehead lift! </p><p><em>A forehead lift is also a very good option.</em></p><p>Sometimes it comes down to your preference. You have a very depleted forehead and that won’t change with a forehead lift. I suspect you might be better served by having a small upper blepharoplasty. It will really come down to what your personal goals are</p><p>I agree that your issues are cosmetic and I think it highly improbable that any insurance company would cover this as medically necessary. </p><p><b>Upper blepharoplasty or forehead lift?</b></p><p>A forehead lift and upper blepharoplasty can both help with improving sagging skin on the upper eyelid and sometimes both together will give the best result. Insurance can sometimes pay for upper blepharoplasty surgery if the sagging skin of the upper eyelid affects the vision</p><p>You would need a visual exam to determine if your vision is affected by the skin. A photo of your full forehead and your eyes would be helpful to give you the best advice. From your limited photo, it does appear that you could potentially benefit from a forehead lift and upper blepharoplasty in India</p><p>Either procedure alone could also lead to improvement however. </p><p><em>Several factors determine cost </em></p><p>There are always three fees associated with eyelid surgery: There is the surgeon’s fee, operating room fee, and anesthesia fee. The fees can range quite extensively depending on the area of the country, surgeon’s expertise, and whether or not it is being done in an office setting under local anesthesia</p><p><strong>The cost of operation in 2012:</strong></p><ul>
