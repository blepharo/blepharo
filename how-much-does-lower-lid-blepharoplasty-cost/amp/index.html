<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>The cost varies by what needs to be done. It is only fair explain why certain procedures cost more or less than others I feel. See the link below for our website and pricing on all our cosmetic surgeries. For upper lid blepharoplasty without ptosis or muscle surgery I charge 2,500 $. For the lower lids it is 2,500 $ for a skin excision and 3,500 $if orbital fat is to be repositioned.</p><p>The reason they differ is the lower lid is much more complicated, time consuming and delicate. A facial analysis in clinic would allow one to give you a realistic quote. (Benjamin Caughlin, MD, Chicago Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Prices vary from city to city. In Dallas, the price of lower lid blepharoplasty will cost between $3,000-4,000. (Jeff Angobaldo, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost of a lower lid blepharoplasty varies, but usually it’s about $3000-$5000 in Toronto. It is generally lower when only local anesthesia is used. (Leila Kasrai, MD, FRCSC, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost of surgery depends on a few factors – If upper and lowers are both being done. If it is being done under local anesthesia or conscious sedation is being administered.</p><p>Surgeon fees can vary by specialty, experience and demand. Expect to pay in the 2-4K range for just lowers however. (Keshini Parbhu, MD, Orlando Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost of Blepharoplasty ranges from $3000 to $4000 for the lower lids. Of course if depends on the intricacy of your procedure. Cost alone should never be a criteria for choosing a Plastic Surgeon. Seek a combination of surgical excellence at a fair price point. (Gilbert Lee, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>The price of cosmetic surgery, of all types varies from region to region. It also may be related to the doctors experience and skill (although you certainly can not go by that alone). 
<p>In our practice all surgery is performed by your surgeon in a fully approved, state of the art surgical center. You are given sedation under the direction of a board certified anesthesiologist. In our practice a typical lower lid cosmetic procedure is $4000 including the price of the operating room and anesthesiologist.</p><p>As you are picking a cosmetic surgeon, be sure you are comparing comparable services and most importantly remember that you are not buying something off the shelf but rather selecting a surgeon for your eyes. Go with your research and comfort level to pick your doctor. (Marc Cohen, MD, Philadelphia Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>The cost varies a lot depending on whether it is performed in the office or requires an operating room with an anesthesiologist. Oculoplastic surgeons tend to be more expensive as they specialize in this particular procedure. 
<p>The most important decision is having the procedure performed by someone you trust and with the right kind of anesthesia that fits your needs. The added cost to be asleep during the procedure is small in the grand scheme of things if it makes the process more comfortable. Some patients on the other hand have no problem with having the procedure performed in the office with just local anesthesia. (Katrinka L.

</div>Cost of eye lid lift can vary from place to place and doctor to doctor. Depending on location, doctors surgical skill and surgical fee’s such as, OR and Anesthesia.
<p><strong>Duration of eyelid lift surgery</strong>: 20 minutes to 2 hours depending on the surgical plan</p><p><strong>Anesthesia</strong>: Local injection in the office for upper lid alone. General anesthesia by a board certified anesthesiologist in an accredited surgical facility or hospital for upper and lower lids</p><p><strong>Cost of eyelid lift plastic surgery, Connecticut</strong>: $3000-$6000 depending on the procedure and the amount of time needed in the OR and anesthesia. (Alfred Sofer, MD, FACS, Fairfield Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You should expect the cost of lower lid surgery to be around $2500. I can be done in a surgeon’s office under local anesthesia. (Ronald J. Edelson, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost for a lower eyelid surgery varies by region and surgeon. The usual cost is between $3500 – $4500. (Jose E. Barrera, MD, FACS, San Antonio Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost of lower lid blepharoplasty is about $1000 per lid, and there may be additional costs like facility and anesthesia fees. This should be discussed with your surgeon before surgery</p><h3>Depends where you go- here are our fees</h3><p>For upper eyelids, with skin only/minimal fat, I would recommend under local anesthesia . The fee at our office is $1500. For lower eyelids, a subcilliary approach with muscle/fat repositioning is best done under IV sedation or general. Our fee for that procedure is $4000.For both procedures combined, under IV sedation, the fee is $5000. (Marwan R. Khalifeh, MD, Chevy Chase Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>There are some questions to consider when consulting an eyelid expert about lower lid surgery and cost. 
<p>You should ask if the surgeon is approach the eye bags or the eyelid skin on the lower eyelid. You should also ask if they will addressing the laxity of the lower lid and the heaviness of the midface/cheek. Finally you should ask if they are skilled in transpositioning of the eye fat bags towards the tear trough to help fill eye hollows or if they excise the fat. </p><p>Once all of these questions are answered, pricing will make more sense. You should find an eyelid expert who focuses on this area through years of training and a focus around the eyes. Pricing is regional but ask detailed questions to know what you are paying for.

</div>Asking how much a blepharoplasty costs is like asking how much a car costs: a 1992 Mazda Miata was sexy at the time but is worth nothing now, it’s styling is obsolete and technology has improved leaps and bounds. 
<p>The same is true for blepharoplasty surgery, technique and aesthetics have improved dramatically, for the better, when compared to 20 and even 10 years ago. Old school blepharoplasty technique involved external, skin and muscle incisions with excess removal of fat and had poor long term results and adverse effects: hollowness and disruption of normal eyelid position from scarring. Newer technique have no external incisions and perform all work through the inside of the eye, with fat repositioning instead of removal, which improves the cosmetic outcomes and nearly eliminates the eyelid position issues. </p><p>This technique is called transconjunctival blepharoplasty, and most well-trained, modern surgeons prefer this technique. One area that you can save some cost is on the anesthesia. Most well-trained, modern era surgeons should be more than comfortable performing this under local anesthesia only. I perform almost all of these procedures this way with pure comfort on the patients end, and this increases first and foremost the safety of the the procedure, the recovery ease, time spent at clinic, and of course cost. </p><p></p>

<strong>In summary</strong>: DONT MAKE THIS DECISION BASED ON PRICE. You get what you pay for. To ensure you are receiving the highest level of care, seek out a dermatologic surgeon, oculoplastic surgeon, facial plastic surgeon or plastic surgeon who is board certified and fellowship trained in one of these “core four” cosmetic specialties. (Cameron Chesnut, MD, FAAD, FACMS, Spokane Dermatologic Surgeon)
<p>Roughly $2500 for lower lids +anesthesia fees if used. Slightly less for upper lids. Sometimes fat grafting is done in conjunction with the lower lids. (Hannah Vargas, MD, Kansas City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Lower eyelid surgery cost</h3><p>It costs with all included fees such as OR Recovery nursing anesthesia follow up etc $2500 fro teh transconjunctival.no skin cuts no suture back to work in 2 days.

</div>The cost for lower eyelid blepharoplasty Can be from $2000-$10,000 depending on the surgeon and the geographic area. (Tanveer Janjua, MD, Bedminster Facial Plastic Surgeon)
<h3>Laser-assisted lower bleph pricing</h3><p>There is a growing trend amongst some cosmetic surgeons to perform lower eyelid surgery to remove herniated fat pads using a carbon dioxide laser to approach the fat from just above the lower lashes on the supraciliary mucosa. This procedure limits downtime because there is no skin incision. In my office, we often perform fractionated CO2 laser treatment of the skin at the same time when recovery times allow for 5-7 days. </p><p></p>

</div>We charge $3500 for this procedure under local anesthesia and patients do very well in the office. Prices can double for adding an anesthesiologist in a surgery center. (Michael Howard Swann, MD, Springfield Dermatologic Surgeon)
<p>Lower lid blepharoplasty (lower eyelid surgery, or surgery to remove the bags under the eyes) can vary widely in cost, depending on your unique anatomy and the surgical complexity of the operation required to address your concerns. For this reason, I require an in-person consultation before determining an exact price estimate. Costs also vary according to geography and the expertise of the surgeon. I advise patients to think of plastic surgery as a lifetime decision and serious committment, and to choose a surgeon based on quality and results, rather than based on price. (Lara Devgan, MD, MPH, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Costs for a lower eyelid lift, lower blepharoplasty, will certainly vary depending on your location. Things to factor in for the procedure standpoint will be the facility fee, anesthesia fee, surgeon fee, other fees (e.g., materials, addition of any other surgical procedure, etc.). A range in price ~$4-9 is not unreasonable. </p><p></p>

</div>$4-6k would be a reasonable cost on average. A consultation with a plastic surgeon will help you in determining which procedure(s) would be the right one for you. Cost also depends on the complexity of your case and how much work would need to be done to achieve an aesthetically-pleasing result for you. (Lewis Albert Andres, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)
<h3>Lower Blepharoplasty Ranges Anywhere From $3,000 to $8,000</h3><p>Costs for plastic surgery procedures differ from one doctor to the next. It also differs from one geographic location to the next. Recent statistics published by the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery indicate that the average surgeon fee for the performance of upper and lower eyelid surgery performed at the same time is $2,724. </p><p>This fee does not include the cost of the anesthesiologist if one is required nor does it include the fee for the use of the operative facility. Sometimes an anesthesiologist is not required so that particular fee is not included. In general, one would expect that the range for either upper eyelid surgery performed by itself or lower lid blepharoplasty performed by itself would range anywhere from $3,000 to $7,000 or $8,000. (John J. Edney, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It differs from cities and the practice. We charge $3,500 including the operating room and anesthesiologist fees.
