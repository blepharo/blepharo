If you only remove skin and leave lax muscle and fat behind you will not see a nice result. I always remove a strip of muscle beneath the skin during Upper Eyelid Blepharoplasty</p><p>My opinion is that the healing of the muscle and skin create a more defined Supra tarsal Fold-the nice aesthetic crease above the eye lashes. In younger patients who have hollow upper eyelids or who have no excess aft, only skin and muscle is excised </p><p><em>Upper Blepharoplasty typically involves removal of excess skin, muscle and fat</em></p><h3>Scar treatment</h3><p>The eyelid skin typically heals well but some may develop scarring that is atypical. You may benefit from scar revision/ excision or laser treatment. </p><p><em>Improving the quality of a scar</em></p><p>Your options for improving the quality of this scar include use of silicone adhesive sheeting (works best in the first few months), laser treatment, or scar revision. The best approach for you depends on the nature of the scar</p><p>I would advise seeking a second opinion from a plastic surgeon who focuses on eyelift surgery. </p><p><strong>Hollowness of eyelids</strong></p><p>Sometimes fillers like restylane or even sometiems fat inejctions can be performed to fill our the upper lids after over-resection but an exam would be necessary to assess this. </p><p>Volume can be placed in and around the eyelid with micro fat injections or with fillers. Sounds like miscommunication…..and perhaps returning to discuss you issues would be pertinent.</p><h4>Best Correction for Hollowed Appearance After Aggressive Blepharoplasty</h4><p></p>

</div>Restylane can be used, but you need to make sure that you find a qualified expert as the eyelid area is most delicate and unforgiving
<p>Some would use fat transfer, but in this area I feel that the risks are too high, especially if you are relatively young. Sorry that your blepharoplasty turned out so unsatisfactory. </p><p><b>Is It Too Risky Having a Brow Lift and a Blepharoplasty on Top and Bottom Eyelids Performed at the Same Time?</b></p><p>No it is not too risky to have the Brows and Eyelids done at the same time. Yes it takes longer but you have one anaesthetic and one recovery.</p><p>Financially it will be cheaper than three surgeries performed separately</p><p>A Brow lift and Upper Eyelid Surgery should be viewed as two parts of one operation that gives you a good final result. If you wish you can have the lower eyelids later. </p><p><i>Usually not necessary</i></p><p>With an experienced surgeon, it is unlikely that you should need separate surgeries to achieve symmetry. Most often than not [95% plus] no further surgery is necessary when these three procedures are done together. And in the other 5% of cases, one revision would solve the problem</p><p>So what you are suggesting is doing surgery three times for what can be achieved in one surgery 95% of the time, and two surgeries 5% of the time. Overkill, in my opinion.<br>

<i>Brow lift with upper and lower lid blepharoplasty</i><p>It is acceptable to undergo upper and lower lid blepharoplasty and brow lift simultaneously. We have done this many times in our practice over the last 20 +years, and patients have done very well. Please see the link below for examples of browlift and blepharoplasties</p><p><b>Lower eyelid trough</b></p><p>The under eye lower eyelid trough with associated dark circles can definitely be improved with fillers. However, a transconjunctival blepharoplasty with fat transposition in Escondido will lead to a longer lasting result that does not have to be repeated</p><h5>Surgery or Filler for Lower Eyelids</h5><p>You did not say who you saw for the opinions you received. To find out whether a lower Blepharoplasty with fat repositioning or fillers is best for your problem, you need to be sure that the person you consult is an expert in both Blepharoplasty and use of fillers<br>

</div>If the physician is more comfortable with one more than the other, then that is what will be suggested. 
<h4>Options for lower lid eyelid surgery</h4><p>There are many options for lower eyelid surgery. There may be laser eyelid surgery done to either make incisions and perform eyelid surgery to work on the bags under the eye. There may also be laser surgery to help tighten the skin underneath the eye</p><p>Be sure to ask questions about where exactly the laser surgery or traditional surgery is being performed on the lower eyelid and consult an oculoplastics specialist if you want someone who focuses on this area alone</p><h4>Escondido Blepharoplasty & Insurance Coverage </h4><p></p>

</div>Sometimes insurance will pay for an upper lid blepharoplasty. If the upper lid droops enough to significantly impair a patient’s visual fields, then insurance may cover the upper lid repair. Normally, they do not cover lower lid surgery
<p>If you think you have visual field impairment, talk to your plastic surgeon. Normally, the plastic surgeon will take photographs and obtain visual field mappings from an ophthalmologist or optometrist. If there is sufficient documentation to demonstrate impairment of vision, then the insurance company may pay for the procedure</p><p><strong>Most Insurance Companies View Blepharoplasty as a Cosmetic, Elective Procedure</strong></p><p>The majority of blepharoplasties are viewed as cosmetic by insurance companies. Rarely, insurance carriers will cover the expense of an isolated upper eyelid blepharoplasty in Escondido. Under these circumstances the insurance company will declare that the procedure is medically necessary<br>

</div>Before this can occur, the insurance carrier requires that certain criteria are met. These include medical documentation of symptoms and physical findings associated with visual field obstruction. In addition, they require formal visual field studies performed by an ophthalmologist or optometrist
<p>These studies must confirm the presence of significant visual field obstruction. Once these studies are complete, a prior authorization letter is sent to the third party payer. This should include the visual field studies and any other pertinent information</p><p>If the insurance companies criteria are met, then occasionally they will cover the expense of blepharoplasty surgery in Escondido. </p><h5> Will bruising after a blepharoplasty go away</h5><p>Most visible bruising and swelling after a blepharoplasty has dissipated at 2 weeks. On a rare occasion a bruise may last upwards of 3-4 weeks, and in some select individuals that extended bruise can lead to something called hemosiderin deposits<br>
</p>

</div>This is a condition where the iron pigments from the red blood cells are trapped in the skin on the lower lids and this can take upwards of 6 months to go away. Makeup and re-assurance and time is usually all that it is required
<p>For many examples of eyelid surgery, please see the link to our blepharoplasty photo Gallery </p><h4>Bruisestick ointment for eyelid surgery bruising</h4><p>I would begin pulsed dye laser therapy and use a Bruisestick ointment on the skin three times daily. </p><p><b>Persistent bruising</b></p><p>This should go away. However it is important to note that the skin beneath the lower eyelids is extremely thin and in some individuals quite transparent. Congested blood vessels after blepharoplasty eye bag removal are very visible and dispersed blood products from the healing process ( echymosis) black and blue can persist for months before they get removed<br>

<p><b>Levator apponeurosis and muller muscle in eyelid</b></p><p>Sometimes contact lens cause dehisence of attachment between levator apponeurosis and tarsal plate. It makes your right eye droopy and eyebrow high. Usually frontalis muscle try to overcome droopy eyelid to elevate eyebrow. Now your status is normal but it could get worse</p><p>We called it aquired ptosis. Non-incisional mild ptosis correction is very easy procedure. </p><p><em>Eye asymmetry</em></p><p>The asymmetry shown in the photo is within normal limits. Everyone has some degree of asymmetry. The ability to move one eyebrow versus the other is also not uncommon. If you are concerned and this is a progressive issue, see a facial specialist to evaluate you for rare conditions that can lead to progressive asymmetry<br>

</div><h3> Lower eyelids Puffiness, what are my best options?</h3><p>When patients have puffiness in the lower lids, this is caused from a herniation of the fatty deposits in the lower lids. In our practice, we perform a conservative removal of this fatty deposits through an incision on inside on the eyelid, also known as a trans-conjunctival approach</p><p>For more information about lower blepharoplasty in Escondido, many before-and-after examples and our current price list, please see the link and the video below </p><h3>Lower eyelid bags</h3><p>I agree with the other surgeons advice, transconjunctival blepharoplasty with fat repositioning is likely to give you the best long term result. An acceptable alternative with slightly less downtime would be limited lower eyelid fat excision combined with fat grafting or cosmetic fillers to your lower eyelid margin (nasojugal groove, orbito malar groove, cheek)<br>

<b>Transconjunctival lower blepharoplasty with fat repositioning for under eye bags/puffiness</b><p>You have significant under eye bags which are orbital fat prolapse, along with hollowness below the bags. The best long-term procedure is tranconjunctival lower blepharoplasty with fat/bags repositioning. See following surgical video and link</p><p>See an oculoplastic specialist. </p><p><i>I agree that upper eyelids are not prone to keloids but caution is advised here.</i></p><p>True keloids of the eyelid are extremely rare. However, it is worth bringing your concerns to the attention of your surgeon. The surgeon will assess scars on your body and your medical history to determine if you have a true problem with how you heal your scars<br>

</div>Also I will advise extreme caution in picking a surgeon to address your congenital ptosis in India. You want to find someone who has fellowship training specifically in eyelid plastic surgery or pediatric ophthalmology and a residency training in ophthalmology
<p>They should have a reputation in congenital ptosis surgery. A general plastic surgeon, general ophthalmologist, or facial plastic surgeon are generally not going to possess the skills to help you. You might look up Miland Naik in Hyderbad, India</p><p>If it is too far to see him, his office might have a referral closer to home for you. </p><h5>Candidate for lower Blepharoplasty </h5><p>You should send a close up photo of your eyes looking upward in order to accurately assess the need for a lower Blepharoplasty in Escondido. Based on the photos you did send, you don’t have bags(fat) under the eyes but just dark skin pigmentation that gives the “dark circles” under the eyes<br>

</div>A Blepharoplasty will not help that at all and neither will fillers because you do not have the deep tear trough appearance. A series of very light peels such as the Vi peel may be the only way to minimize the dark circles
<h3>Lower blepharoplasty candidacy</h3><p>From the photos you provided I doubt that a lower eyelid lift is the best and first option I would recommend. In fact, some gentle filling (i.e. using Restylane) may provide you with a meaningful benefit</p><p>You may be candidate for lower blepharoplasty with fat transposition (where the existing puffiness/fat is repositioned inferiorly to fill up the hollowness or dark circles). Filler injecting may be another option</p><p>See an oculoplastic surgeon for evaluation. </p><p><b>Hollow Eyes After Blepharoplasty </b></p><p>The presence of creepy skin and hollowness can occur after blepharoplasty but with the aging process it is likely the aging process the main issue. Bone resorption and thinning of our skin is all part of the aging process</p><p>Sometimes over removal of fat pads can exacerbate the condition. Having a natural fullness of the upper eyelid is a youthful look. I think plastic surgeons today are well attuned to a more conservative removal of fat and skin of the upper and lower eyelid</p><p>Addressing the problem ten years later is not an easy problem to solve. Fillers can be used to treat the hollow areas around the lower eyelid. Fat grafting to the upper eyelid can not give you reassurance that this will be a consistent result</p><p></p>

</div>My suggestion is to address the hollowness first of the lower eyelid and creepy skin with chemical peels to the lower eyelid. However, it is very important than the lower eyelid remain in a youthful position and if it is not I would focus on it rather the creepy skin or hollowness
<p><strong>Insurance coverage of blepharoplasty </strong></p><p>each carrier has specific criteria. Most require that the patient complains about loss of vision affecting activities of daily living, photographs demonstrating eyelid skin position and visual field testing showing a certain % of peripheral vision loss and improvement upon manual skin elevation</p><h5>Bleph and midface lift</h5><p>You really would benefit from a lower blepharoplasty removing the wrinkles and dark skin and a midface lift to correct the hollow beneath it (the “tear trough”.) Fillers would not correct the wrinkled skin nor would fat transfers</p><p>I have operated on someone about your age with a similar problem with a nice result. </p><h3>Lower Blepharoplasty Techniques and Dry Eyes</h3><p>The skin pinch technique for lower blepharoplasty is a method for removing a small amount of excess lower lid skin. It is nice in that it does not disrupt the obicularis muscle, and is relatively safe</p><p>Other options for a similar change would be a skin flap blepharoplasty or resurfacing (laser or chemical peel). The skin flap technique allows for skin smoothing further from the lash margin, but has a higher bleeding risk</p><p>The peel also can smooth the skin further from the lash margin, but runs the risk of pigmentary change (which is more of an issue in patients with darker complexion). All of these techniques that tighten lower lid skin run the risk of dry eyes</p><p></p>

</div>To think about it in simplistic terms: if the lower eyelid tone (the force holding the eyelid against the eyeball) is not good and the skin tightening is enough to get the eyelid to not smoothly glide on the eyeball, you will end up with dry eyes
<p>If you have poor lid tone, a lid tightening procedure (such as a muscle pexy with or without canthopexy/canthoplasty) will be required in addition to the skin procedure when doing your lower lid surgery in Escondido</p><p>You would be best served by visiting with a surgeon who specializes in lid surgery, and ask them what they recommend (and why), rather than shopping for a particular procedure. </p><h5>Options for lower lid</h5><p>Reviewing your photos suggest that you have a deep tear trough deformity along with moderate pseudo-herniation of lower periorbital fat especially pronounced with facial expression such as smiling. Your best and longer lasting improvement will be with a trans-conj bleph, fat repositions and possibly skin pinch; however, you will see improvement especially at rest with good HA filler injection of the tear-trough</p><p>This type of injection requires skill and experience and I would strongly encourage anyone considering this type of treatment to find an experienced dermatologist, facial plastic, general plastic or occuloplastic surgeon. </p><p>Escondido, CA ZIP Codes: 92025, 92026, 92027, 92029, 92030, 92033, 92046.</p><p><em>Surgery eyelid clinic price list in 2013:</em></p><ul>
