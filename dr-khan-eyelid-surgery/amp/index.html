Repair of the most common type of ptosis is accomplished with the same local anesthesia and it is recommended that you be somewhat cooperative at least so that the surgeon can measure the degree of correction of the ptosis.</p><p>It is impossible to do under general anesthesia. A mild sedative like Valium or Ativan can calm your nerves while the local anesthesia is placed, but once it is numb, you won’t feel anything. </p><p>The transconjunctival lower blepharoplasty with removal of lower eyelid fat can be a fantastic option for the right person. The key with any surgery is case selection. So a young person with just a bit of a lower eyelid bulge will have a great results with a small resection of lower fat using this approach</p><p>However, take too much fat or in individuals with a whole lot of lower eyelid issues like skin and eyelid laxity, cheek descent, etc and now you have a situation that will not do well with this approach</p><p>Conserving the lower eyelid fat is helpful when there is enough lower eyelid fat to be rotated into the top of the cheek in association with a hollowness in the under eye area. Again the key is individual selection</p><p>Generally individuals with thicker skin and good integrity of the lower eyelid ligaments do best with this type of procedure. Bottom line is that not every approach is right for every situation. The choice is much more art than science<br>

<i>Assymetry post bleph/coronal</i><p>Since you are only 5 weeks there will be some settling. Your right lower lid is retracted and maybe some upward massage may help. Also maybe a little botox to lower the brow that is higher.</p><p>A revision may be needed.</p><p><em>‘Bulges’ Along Incision Line After Upper Eyelid Surgery Normal</em></p><p>After only nine days it is not unusual to see some fullness along an incision line. </p><p>Depending on the suture technique, sometimes there is localized swelling between the skin edge and the stitch which causes it to bulge up a bit.</p><p>This is normal in most cases. Fortunately, as time goes on, this in most cases goes away. Sometimes, we may recommend massage but care must be taken not to open up and disrupt the skin incision at this early time.</p><p>Follow your surgeon’s instructions with regards to this.</p><h3>Lower blepharoplasty with out epinephrine.</h3><p>Yes, you can have a lower blepharoplasty without epinephrine, but it makes the procedure, more difficult because of bleeding. You may have had a bad experience with epinephrine at the dentist, because the dentist may have injected epinephrine in a sensitive spot.<br>

<em>Eyelid surgery and Neck surgery</em><p>If you have not smoked in three weeks or longer, it is safe to proceed with neck and/or eyelid surgery, provided other general health and local issues do not contraindicate the procedures you are considering</p><h5>Tear trough deformity treatment</h5><p>In my hands, the best option for you based on the photographs you’ve provided is a transconjunctival blepharoplasty with fat repositioning and not excision. I believe this will give the most natural and longest lasting improvement.</p><p><b>Eyelid Surgery Specialist</b></p><p>As for any surgery, it is best to go on referrals from trusted sources and see a Board Certified Surgeon well trained and knowledgeable about the latest techniques to do the procedure. Look at before and after photos and choose the surgeon with whom you have the best rapport.<br>

</div>I don’t believe it’s necessary to insist on an oculoplastic surgeon unless you have ptosis (loss of muscle attachment of the eyelid) or a complicated revision.
<p><i>There are more than one specific specialty that performs blepharoplasty</i></p><p>I understand your dilemma. There is a significant amount of mis-guided and misinformation on the internet about what type of plastic surgery specialist to have do your procedure. There are a few factors to consider here.</p><p>First off, you should ask the surgeon how many of the particular procedure you are seeking, he or she performs per week or month or year. If they only do that procedure occasionally, that should be taken into consideration. You should also see at least 10 or more before and after photos of that procedure performed by that surgeon and ask if the results you are looking at are typical of his or her work.<br>
</p>

</div>Ask that surgeon what his or her revision rate is (how often does he or she need to touch up the surgery). Now realize that there are many fine General Plastic Surgeons around. Some may even perform mostly facial surgery.
<p>In many cases however, the general plastic surgeon spends a significant amount of their time performing body surgery e.g. tummy tucks and breast surgery. On the other hand, there are also Facial Plastic Surgeons that are originally head and neck surgery trained (ENT) that may only, daily, perform facial plastic surgery.</p><p>In addition, Oculoplastic Surgeons are Ophthalmology trained physicians that then also complete an Oculoplastic surgery fellowship in plastic surgery of the eye and surrounding region. With the latter two specialties, both the Facial Plastic Surgeon as well as the Oculoplastic Surgeon may be better versed than the Plastic Surgeon who operates from head to toe.<br>
</p>

</div>Overall, you have to find a surgeon that you like, treats you with respect, listens to your expectations, and is open and honest about their comfort performing the surgery you are seeking and shows you numerous examples of cases they personally performed.
<p>Don’t let one specialty group convince you that they are the best and the only group of surgeons the public should seek. That is disingenuous behavior.</p><h5>Transconj. blepharoplasty or not</h5><p>If you simply have an excess of fatty tissue, the transconjunctival bleph. works great…as long as the fat is removed evenly, and not too much is removed. , it seems like this could certainly work well for you</p><p>If there is some excess skin, the TC bleph can be combined with a simple skin pinch technique, for a nice result. Your surgeon can help you with this decision.<br>

<b>You should do your eyelid surgery</b><p>Thanks for the inquiry, bottom line is you should go to someone in your community Who has good reputation and plenty of photos as evidence of their work. Plastic surgeons will say you need to go to board-certified plastic Surgeon but that’s not necessarily true</p><p>Basically you want to go to someone who has a focus and eyelid surgery. Just be aware there is no board certification for oculoplastic surgeons But that doesn’t mean much. You may want to take a look at facial plastic surgeons who are board-certified</p><p>Go to the person you feel most comfortable with and who has a good track Record</p><h5>Eyelid drooping</h5><p>If you feel like your eyes are getting tired, I would go get a medical check-up by an ophthamologist (not an optometrist). It is rare for someone of your age to need eyelid surgery, or blepharoplasty, and given your look, I don’t think it would help<br>
You want to make sure there aren’t other things going on, medically speaking, that are causing your eyelids to become tired. Try to make a note to see if the tiredness is worse at the end of the day versus when you wake up</p><p>If you are all cleared, I agree with the other docs, that a little Botox or Dysport under the outer part of your brow will give a little lift that you may like. Best, Nima Shemirani</p><h4>This photos are just not helpful.</h4><p>Upper eyelid surgery is probably your best option. It really depends precisely on what is going on and what bothers you. Eyelid heaviness or ptosis, crepey upper eyelid skin, and eyelash ptosis are all issues that should be addressed with eyelid surgery<br>
</p>

</div>There are of course other options but nothing has the power of actual eyelid surgery. I recommend you down load and study by ebook on eyelid surgery. It is available at the link below.
<h3>Lower blepharoplasty incisions</h3><p>The incisions for lower blepharoplasty are very difficult to notice. They are most frequently don on the inside of the eyelid where they are invisible. Sometimes, an incision is made below the lashes. This heals remarkably well and is almost always not noticeable after a few weeks to months</p><p><strong>Do not fly immediately after eyelid surgery</strong></p><p>I do not agree with the intent of the previous expert posters. I would recommend NOT to fly immediately after eyelid surgery NO MATTER WHAT! Stay overnight and be checked the next morning by your doctor<br>
This is a very safe course of action. As for doing any cosmetic surgery out of town, I at first was totally against it. But now I see patients flying from all over so I have changed my opinion</p><p>I do require a minimium of 3 nights stay in MIAMI<br>
