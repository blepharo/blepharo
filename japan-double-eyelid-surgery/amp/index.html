<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Blepharoplasty in Japan is popular due to low complication rate. All surgeries have possible risk of infection, poor scar appearance, anesthetic reactions. Specific to Blepharoplasty are eyelid function problems from excess skin removal, (inability to close lids), occasional injury to the elevating/levator muscle of the upper lid, and, very,very rarely blindness of an eye</p><p>The popularity of these procedures attest to the high “benefit to risk” ratio. See a Board Certified Surgeon to optimize your chances of having an excellent outcome. </p><h4>Complications from eyelid surgery most often involve the lower lids.</h4><p>Malposition of the lower lid is probably the most common unwanted byproduct of blepharoplasty. It is more common in older patients who have poor lid support but can occur in anyone. It is treatable. It is uncommon</p><p>Other complications can occur but are rare. Eyelids are well innervated so post-op hypersensitivity is common although it would not be considered a complication, just an undesired side effect. </p><p><em>Eyelid fullness in a young person</em></p><p>Eyelid fullness in a young person can be corrected the same regardless of your age. If the lacrimal gland is protruding as maybe the case in you, it can be tucked up during your upper eyelid surgery so that it is no longer visible. </p><p>The procedure is commonly done by an oculoplastic or facial plastic surgeon and it is a low risk procedure especially if done conservatively. The main risk you need to consider is how do you heal from scarring</p><p>Some African American skin types keloid and that could lead to a poor scar that is visible. Genearlly, if you have any other scars on you and they healed fine you should be fine then<br>

</div>While the fat in your eyelids will not change the fat in your cheeks will, and thus there will be some further changes around the eyes if you continue to lose weight. Eyelids often look puffier with weight loss as the fat is lost in other parts of your face
<p>I would consider having the lid surgery as a reward once you have achieved your target weight.</p><h3>You can have lower eyelid blepheroplasty now</h3><p>Weight loss has not much effect on eyelid bags. You can approach eyelid issues independent of weight issues. </p><h4> Lower blepharoplasty with a healthy BMI</h4><p>It is acceptable to undergo a lower blepharoplasty in Japan at any time either before or after the weight loss. The fatty deposits in the lower lids that are creating the puffiness look are not related to weight gain or loss, so it is acceptable to undergo a blepharoplasty procedure any time<br>

</div>As you can see from virtually every answer that you have received, it is WAY too early to start obsessing over your results. 
<p>The effects of swelling and scarring are just beginning. Relax and trust in your surgeon</p><p>You must have trusted him/her before eyelid surgery in Japan. Keep the faith. </p><p><strong>Wait a bit longer</strong></p><p>Like with any surgery, it is very difficult to evaluate the final result until the swelling has dissipated, and even then the results may not be fully present for several months. You really should give it some time to heal</p><p><strong>Everyone wants immediate gradification – just needs more time</strong></p><p>You are still very early in the healing process and you need to give it more time. I usually advocate early gentle massage of the lower eyelid from medial to lateral. This generally helps to keep the lower lid supple<br>

</div>As far as the asymmetry, this is extremly normal and will just take more time to resolve. Speak with your surgeon, voice your concerns and you can be assured that the best advice is just more time
<p><strong>Blend the lower eyelid junction with the thick cheek skin</strong></p><p>Your photo seems to show contrast between the lower eyelid skin and the thicker cheek skin creating a so called tear trough deformity. </p><p>Don’t do anything to your eyelids but judicious placement of a filler on the orbital bone immediately behind the depressed groove should help transition these two areas more harmoniously</p><p>One of the hyaluronic acid gels would work just fine. Do NOT use Radiesse in the tear trough grooves ever! </p><p><b>Skin pinch usually combined with trans-conjunctival blepharoplasty in Japan</b></p><p>Lower lid blepharoplasty in Japan will continue to be a facial plastic procedure prone to complications and/or poor aesthetic outcome if not performed with care, accurate technique and artistry after appropriate assessment. Because fat removal through a trans-conjunctival approach can leave a patient with additional skin and skin wrinkles, a skin pinch has been advocated by some surgeons<br>

</div>Other plastic surgeons favor skin resurfacing (peel or laser resurfacing) to tighten skin. Personally, I prefer the skin-muscle flap approach where skin removal (just a little!) is one component of the procedure. In general, complications can be seen even with a skin pinch
<p>I certainly have consulted on patients who where left with ectropion after skin pinch. </p><p>You have found a qualified plastic surgeon with whom you have an ongoing professional relationship and whose previous work you have seen and like. I’m still not sure what your question is? </p><p>Japan Upper or lower Blepharoplasty procedures are done in a short amount of time and are always an Outpatient Procedure. </p><h4>Lower eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty) and malar bags</h4><p></p>

</div>A lower blepharoplasty  in Japan if done correctly, can correct malar bags. Sometimes there is some loose skin which needs to be removed, but more often, the cause is fat which has descended out of it’s original position
<p>This fat needs to be repositioned-not removed, in order to achieve a youthful lower eyelid/cheek junction. This can be performed by a board certified plastic surgeon or a board certified ocuoplastic surgeon.</p><h4>Blepharoplasty Contouring can be adjusted with Restylane or Juvederm</h4><p>Blepharoplasty in Japan can alter the eyelid show following surgery. In general it can take 6 months to a year for the eyelid swelling to settle. Minor adjustments to a hollowness sometimes seen in thinner people in the upper or lower lids can be diminished with off label use of filler products such as Restylane or Juvederm<br>

</div>It is always a good idea to discuss your options with your plastic surgeon as they will be able to examine the eyelids and make a better assessment of all the possibilities. 
<h4>Save the fat with blepharoplasty</h4><p>You are right in that loss of fat around the eyes contributes to the appearance of aging. In a younger patient with bags under the eyes, removal of the fat will look OK for a while in many cases but then much worse later, which is why the trend now to preserve the fat and reposition it</p><p>It may be possible to have some fat grafted back in or use a graft of tissue to restore some volume.<br>

<strong>Eyelid hollowness following surgery</strong><p>If you thought the left eye was “perfect” why in the world would you let anyone operate on it? You best option at this point is to use a filler such as Juvederm in the upper lid sulcus which will decrease the eyelid show</p><p><i>Lower eyelid revision</i></p><p>Skin and fat removal really isn’t the best way to treat lower eyelids. If you have had this done twice you may have a hollow skeletonized lower eyelid that pulls or is rounded. Lower eyelid improvement is about two things, the shape of the underlying tissue and the quality (not quantity) of the overlying skin</p><p>Extra skin is almost never the cause of lower eyelid problems and taking skin out rarely results in improvement and is risky for complication. Skin quality (crepe and wrinkles) is addressed with laser resurfacing. The shape of the lower eyelid should ideally be a smooth fullness that blends seemlessly into the upper cheek<br>

</div>Probably you need to have volume added to your eyelid to blend into the pocket of fat rather than removal of the pocket. You may also need to have your lower eyelid supported if it is pulled or rounded
<p>After having skin removed from your lower eyelid twice, you may no longer be a candidate for laser resurfacing because of the added tightness it creates. </p><h3>Skin only upper blepharoplasty in Japan</h3><p>You will benefit most from upper blepharoplasty (with skin only removal). Lateral brow lift will give some enhancement too. </p><p><b>Blepharoplasty …When Will Dark Circles From Bruising Disappear?</b></p><p>Bruising after lower eye lid surgery usually goes away within a few months. You may use nightly warm compresses in the area to facilitate clearing of the bruising. It should clear up<br>

</div><h3>Preop Opthalmology evaluation for dry eyes essential</h3><p>Taking a history regarding dry eyes and performing a Schirmer’s test on physical exam are important parts of evaluating patients seeking blepharoplasty. That is because blepharoplasty may worsen existing dry eyes or cause it in patients who didn’t have it before cosmetic surgery eye lift</p><p>The opthalmologist should rule out any diseases contributing to dry eyes and can prescribe a regimen to minimize the problem before corrective eyelid surgery. The surgery itself may need to be more limited in aesthetic goals so that ocular dryness is minimized postop</p><p><strong>Blepharoplasty for eyelid bags in Japan</strong></p><p>If you get a lower blepharoplasty get it only Transconjunctival by a very experienced surgeon since your eyeballs stick out (prophetic) and are prone to pull down with scar. The surgery should be quite minimal or wait<br>

</div><h4>Lower bleph</h4><p>A lower lid blepharoplasty either transcutaneous or transconjunctival, to remove the lower lid fat pads, should not change the shape of your eyes. This can happen with excess skin removal but you do not require this and so it should not affect it</p><p>Discuss this complication with your surgeon. </p><h3>Photos need to be objectively viewed to be properly evaluated. </h3><p>It is difficult to comment accurately from the photos presented. As already mentioned, a full frontal view would be more helpful. No eyelid makeup also would be helpful, That said, it does “appear” that there is fullness below the eyebrow (sub brow) and this could be fat under the orbicularis muscle or even heavy prominent orbital rim bone<br>

</div>A hands on exam would be necessary . See a reputable plastic or oculoplastic surgeon and pay attention to the advice you get……..it should make sense. I don’t think you need a brow lift
<p><em>Upper and Lower Eyelid Surgery</em></p><p>I agree with the consultant who suggested lower eyelid transconjunctival approach with fat re-positioning I do not think at your age there is any need to make incisions on the lower lid. I would also suggest some volume augmentation to the cheek in the form of fat grafting</p><p>Lastly, I would suggest laser skin resurfacing in the lower lid to achieve a small amount of skin tightening. I would also agree with a “skin only” upper blepharoplasty which would rejuvenate the upper lids<br>

</div><h3>Blepharoplasty options.</h3><p>If there is excess skin that is significant then you need an external incision. Otherwise transconjunctival is ok. Your uppers should be left alone and have a browlift instead to prevent hollowness and give you a “happy” look</p><p><b>Eyelid scars</b></p><p>You should return to your surgeon to consider a scar revision. The scars from eyelids surgery usually heal,beautifully, but occasionally a revision may be necessary. Don’t be shy about requesting it! </p><h4>Treating lower eyelid hollow</h4><p>You would benefit from volume augmentation of the entire lower eye region. Once you fill the inner part the hollowness of the out portion will become more apparent. Filling the outer orbital rim will help connect your cheek to your eye and give a very natural filling similar to your last smiling photo<br>
Choices for fillers should either be a fat transfer or hyaluronic acid. The advantage of hyaluronic acid is any problems can be easily addressed by removing it with hyaluronidase. If you are interested in a fat transfer you should make sure that you use someone who is very experienced</p><p>The potential complications from other surgical approaches far exceed the potential problems of these options in experienced hands. </p><p><strong>Lower eyelid</strong></p><p>In my practice, you would receive a transconjunctival fat transposition (shifting fat into the tear trough), release of the orbicularis retaining ligament (to soften the tear trough), dual layer canthopexy of muscle and lateral retinaculum (tightening of the lower eyelid) and skin pinch excision (to tighten and remove skin excess)<br>
You would also benefit from a chemical peel to lighten the dark color of the skin of the lower lid.. You should have a great result if the correct surgery is performed! </p><h3>Upper blepharoplasty versus a forehead lift</h3><p>The photographs presented are not adequate enough to make a determination. It’s important to look at both eyelids and the forehead at rest and without contraction of the frontalis muscle. Upper eyelid blepharolasty can be performed to simply remove the excess skin on the upper lids</p><p>The brow lift procedure can adjust the level of the brows, and adjust the corrugator and frontalis muscles of the forehead as well. The hairline can be adjusted upwards or downwards, depending upon placement of the incision for a brow lift</p><p>For many examples the brow lifting and eyelid surgery, please see the links below </p><p><i>Browlifts are more invasive than upper blephs</i></p><p>In a typical browlift, open or endoscopic, the brow is lifted off the bone across the entire forehead and lifted. This is much more invasive than an upper bleph. Regardless, each one is appropriate for different indications</p><p>ark circles and eye bags can have a variety of causes. In young patients who have had this for a long time, it is often related to a congenital excess of fat in the lower lids</p><p>In looking at your pictures, this is what you appear to have. The best procedure to address this is a transconjunctival lower lid blepharoplasty in Japan. It does an excellent job of filling in the dark line in the tear trough and smooths the junction between your eyelid and cheek<br>

</div><h4>Pain after eyelid surgery</h4><p>Pain after eyelid surgery in Tokio is usually mild. Ice/cold compresses do well. I would say that about half of my patient’s do not take their prescribed pain medicines after surgery, and half do. </p><p><b>Eyelid asymmetry</b></p><p>Asymmetry is not unusual in eyelid surgery. Often, if one eyebrow is higher than the other, it will make the asymmetry more noticeable. You should hold off on any revisions for at least three months</p><p>More skin can than be removed from the lids that is still a little droopy. </p><p><em>Immediate PostOp Swelling Following Eyelid Surgery </em></p><p>In the immediate post-operative period it’s difficult to make judgments about eyelid aesthetics when swelling is present. The first several months following blepharoplasty are characterized by dynamic changes in the eye lids because of wound healing<br>

</div>For these reasons, judgments regarding symmetry should be delayed until swelling has resolved. 
<p>In addition, it’s important to note that your pictures suggest baseline asymmetry of the brows and orbital rims. In your case the right brow and orbital rim seem lower than your opposite side</p><p>This asymmetry can affect the final result in a variety of ways. In some cases, blepharoplasty can unmask baseline asymmetry making it more obvious. In other cases, baseline asymmetry may require the surgeon to make compromises regarding incision placement</p><p>It’s very difficult to evaluate asymmetry in the immediate post-operative period because of swelling. This evaluation can be made even more difficult by baseline asymmetry and the compromises that are necessary to address them<br>

</div>For these reasons, it’s important that you have good communication with your plastic surgeon. It’s important to be patient and make sure all your concerns are addressed. 
<p><i>Prominent fat pads</i></p><p>You have significant fat pads for your age. A transconjunctival is the method of choice for most surgeons these days. There are usually less complications with this approach. From the inside of the lid, the fat can be repositioned inferiorly to fill in the tear trough</p><p>You have so much fat that some may need to be removed as well. If there is excess skin, a pinch of skin can be removed from directly under the lash line . </p><p><em>Blepharoplasty approach</em></p><p></p>

</div>I would recommend a transconjunctival approach for you as this would allow the best access for repositioning your fat pads and obliterating the obvious junction between your lower eyelid and cheek. Depending on the laxity of your lower eyelid, you may also need a procedure to tighten the lid margin
<p>Once these procedures are done, the transconjunctival approach allows for excision of any skin excess. The pictures you have posted show no evidence of a fat deficiency, so I’m not sure why that has been introduced into the equation</p><p>Of course, this is all with the caveat that I have not examined you in person. That is the only way to answer these questions definitively. </p><p>he position of your eyebrows shows how much you are compensating to lift your heavy upper eyelids. You have true upper eyelid ptosis</p><p>Standard blepharoplasty will simple expose a very long and heavy upper eyelid. You need to be carefully assessed by an oculoplastic surgeon who will be able to determine the best surgical approach to address your upper eyelid ptosis, the compensatory eyebrow elevation, and the excess upper eyelid skin</p><p>The American Society for Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery maintains a regional directory that can help you find a very well qualified oculoplastic surgeon in your area (asoprs dot org). </p><h5>Pricing of procedure in 2012:</h5><ul>
