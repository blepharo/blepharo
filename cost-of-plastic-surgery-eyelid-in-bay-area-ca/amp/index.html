<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Eyelid surgery in Bay Area is one area of facial surgery where a conservative approach is imperative. Seeking a board certified plastic surgeon with a great deal of experience with eyelid surgery is also important. For upper lid surgery, inability to close the eye, dry eye syndrome, asymmetry and scarring can all occur, but are rare</p><p>Lower lid surgery has a higher rate of complications. These include lowe lid mal-position (generally sagging to low,) and aninability to close the eye. </p><p>Chemosis, which is a swelling of the surface of the eyebal is common, but generally responds very quickly to topical steroid ointment</p><p>Experience is really the key with this procedure. </p><p><strong>Blepharopalsty complications</strong></p><p>Here are the more common and more remote complications and risks of a blepharoplasty in the upper and lower eyelid from more common to least common: </p><p>1. Assymetry: removing the skin or fat on both sides is an art not a science</p><p>Sometimes there can be residual assymetry that occurs. A little asymmetry actually can look a little more natural than if it is “perfect”. This can be corrected witha touch up procedure if more skin or fat needs to be removed</p><p>2. Irregular incision: The incision of a blepharoplasty in the upper eyelid should be in the lid crease. In the lower eyelid it should be near the lash line. Deviation from that can create a more noticeable scar</p><p>This should soften in appearance in time but is possible. This is determined by the surgeon as they are doing the baggy eye surgery. The irregular incision can be fixed sometimes with another touch up procedure.<br>

</div>3. Bleeding: There is always a risk of bleeding after eyelid surgery
<p>After blepharoplasty if a bleed occurs behind the eye, increased pressure can damage the optic nerve that supplies the eye and cause vision loss. This is an uncommon occurrence but can happen. After surgery for eyelids i tell patients to take it easy, no heavy bending lift stooping for 10 days</p><p>Also for the first 48 hours – 72 hours I have them ice their eyelids and sleep with their head elevated. If you have a bleed you should call your surgeon immediately. I have patients take my cell phone because if there is a retrobulbar (behind the eye) bleed every minute counts<br>

</div>Before cosmetic surgery eyes I make sure that patients are not on blood thinners. (aspirin,coumadin, plavix) 
<p>4. Eyelid closure problems: If too much skin is removed, a patient may have trouble closing their eyes or blinking properly. Also they may have nocturnal lagophthalmos (eyelid closure problems at night). This is most often temporary and resolves with time. If not, further surgery may be needed. </p><p>5. Lower eyelid retraction: If too much skin is removed in the lower eyelid, the lower lid can be pulled down. Steroid injections can occasionally help this but further surgery is usually neeeded. </p><p>6. Slow healing: sometimes it can take a longer for complete healing to occur in some patients. This is dependant on constituion and 99% of people tend to heal up perfectly over time..just takes longer.<br>

</div>7. Since practicing in Bay Area, I have had two patients that came to me from other surgeons who had theiir muscle used to lift the eyelid (levator muscle) accidentally cut during cosmetic surgery eyelids giving the patient a droopy eyelid
<p>This is a remote complication. I retightened the muscle and stitched the cut portions together to return normal eyelid position. </p><p>4. Need for more surgery: For the reasons discussed above. </p><p><em>Correcting Eyelid fullness due to a droopy tear gland</em></p><p>You are worried needlessly, dear. The lacrimal gland is normally hidden behind the upper / side rim of the orbit (eye socket) but frequently sags down and becomes prominent as a side fullness. ALL Plastic surgeons are very familiar with it (this goes double for oculoplastic surgeons)<br>

</div>Tucking the tear gland back up is ROUTINELY done in upper lid (Blepharoplasties). It takes a single stitch and almost no time at all to perform. Don’t be frightened. See a surgeon you trust and things will go well
<p><strong>Surgery for protruding lacrimal glands</strong></p><p>Lacrimal gland prolapse (that’s what it is called when your lacrimal glands appear prominant) is a common problem. This is especially true in African Americans. </p><p>At the time of eye cosmetic surgery the lacrimal glands can be attached back to the correct position and that should completely correct the problem</p><p>Having this done at the time of cosmetic upper eyelid surgery should not make the surgery any more difficult for you to go through.<br>

<strong>Weight loss and lower eyelid fat removal</strong><p>Fat in the lower eyelids is a totally different type of fat than general body fat. When one loses weight, it does NOT affect lower eyelid fat. If you are ready to have your lower eyelid fat removed now, you could certainly go ahead and have it done before you are finished with the rest of your body weight loss</p><p>It is always helpful to get a formal opinion and consultation with a board certified Facial, Ophthalmic or General Plastic surgeon. </p><p>Removng fat does not lead to scleral show. This usually happens with scarring or poor tone. I would avoid further surgery. </p><p><b>Too much eyelid surgery</b><br>

</div>First of all, I agree that you should not have another surgical procedure. If anything, have an HA (Resytlane or Juvederm) injected – and only small amounts. Second of all, it is impossible to evaluate your before and after since you are unanimated in the before pictures and smiling in the after pictures
<p>When you smile, your cheek is naturally going to raise and cause some wrinkling in your lower lids. </p><p><i>Hooded eye treatment at 21. </i></p><p>I will personally have a guy named “Guido” come after you if u let anyone touch your lovely eyes. They are gorgeous and would only be made worse with surgery ! </p><p><em>Hooded Eyes</em></p><p>You are presently 21 years old. Based on a review of your photos, your eyes look appropriate. I would not recommend any surgical intervention at this time<br>

</div><h4>Less is more</h4><p>I think your eyes look perfectly natural. It’s not that important you have a small amount of crepiness to the skin when your eye is closed since your interaction with people is with your eyes open</p><p>Fullness of the upper eyelid crease is actually a sign of youth and excess removal of skin and particularly muscle or fat can lead to hollowing which would make you look older. </p><p><em>Upper blepharoplasty with local anesthesia</em></p><p>For the majority of patients, an upper blepharoplasty with local anesthesia in Bay Area CA is very well tolerated. There is some discomfort as the anesthesia is injected, but you should not have any pain after it has been administered<br>
It really should not have any impact on the safety of a procedure compared to having it performed with IV sedation.</p><h5>Upper lid blepharoplasty under local anesthesia</h5><p>It is a personal decision whether to have an upper lid bleph under local with oral sedation or with IV sedation. Only you know your tolerance level for pain and whether you can handle the injections</p><p>I recommend that you make sure that your surgeon has an accredited operating facility and that you discuss the injections with him prior to making a decision. Many of my patients opt for local with oral medication but, for others, this is something that they’d rather not try<br>

<em>Soft tissue fillers for hollowness around the eyes in a young patient</em><p>At your age you may want to first consider an injectable HA agent such as Juvederm or Restylane. The best part about these injectables is that they are temporary and can be reversed. They can be used to fill in hollowness of both the upper and lower eyelids</p><p>You want to be seen by a plastic surgeon who is experienced with both injectable agents and blepharoplasty surgery in Bay Area because technique is critical to achieving a nice result. A photograph would be nice to help evaluate your cosmetic concerns</p><p><em>Brow position and upper blepharoplasty</em></p><p>Your brow position appears to be adequate. Ideally, there should be an arc from the most medial part of the brow extending laterally an placing the tail of the eyebrow slightly above the medial brow<br>

</div>You have that shape as well as the tail of the brow ending above the orbital rim (edge of the upper eye socket bone). Your main problem appears to be the excess upper lid skin almost touching your lashes
<p>An upper blepharoplasty would most probably be all you need. </p><p><b>Under Eye Hollows.</b></p><p>I’m not sure how long ago your surgery was, but under eye filler can be done. Some have had great results with fat transfer, but they sometimes can resorb unevenly and leave hard nodular areas</p><p>I would recommend if you got a filler to get a hyaluronic acid filler as it can be reversed with an enzyme, and seeing an experienced oculoplastic surgeon. All fillers can carry some vision risk if it becomes injected into the blood stream although this is very rare<br>

<b>Blepharoplasty approach</b><p>The best option requires considering your medical history and history of previous eye problems in the past. </p><p>I find in most cases, that a transconjunctival fat removal is best. It gives excellent opportunity to reduce the fat compartments without damaging the overlying muscle</p><p>I believe that cutting the muscle is the main reason for lid malposition after healing. Procedures such as a canthopexy exist to reduce this risk if a transcutaneous blepharoplasty in Bay Area is performed, but add to swelling and recovery time</p><p>I rarely need it with the transconj approach. The skin can be tightened as separate layer with either a small skin pinch excision or laser/chemical peel. Since the muscle Is still not being cut or removed, the risk of lid malposition is reduced<br>

</div>Once the blepharoplasty is done, maintain a good skin care regiment to keep things smooth through the years.
<p><b>Blepharoplasty Options</b></p><p>Bay Area transconjunctival blepharoplasty approaches the fat compartments from the inside of the lid and is used when the skin is tight. Whereas, the Transcutaneous approach enters from the outside to remove skin and fat. A combination of approaches may be used to remove fat from the inner lid and only remove a small amount of skin from the outer lid when necessary</p><p>Using both approaches the scars are minimium and the inner fat is removed. </p><h5>You will need in person evaluation for ptosis</h5><p>Your eye brow are raised too high and that can be due to the compensation for the ptosis.

<b>Upper eyelid surgery will correct the droopy lids.</b><p>Your photo shows heavy upper eyelid skin, which gives you a tired/sleepy look. The skin is slightly hooded. An upper lid blepharoplasty in Bay Area will likely markedly improve your appearance, giving your eyes a refreshed, alert appearance</p><p>Exactly what would need to be done at eyelid procedure could only be determined by a hands – on examination by your surgeon. Upper lid surgery can frequently be done with a small amount of sedation and local anesthesia, sparing you the expense of general anesthesia</p><p>After the lids are numbed, the excess skin is meticulously measured and trimmed and sutured closed, (I prefer all my sutures to be buried under the skin so no sutures need to be removed), and the patient can go home<br>
The entire procedure takes about 1 hour and recovery is quick. </p><p><b>Blepharoplasty Transconjunctival or transcutaneous.?</b></p><p>I have done both for 35 years so I see adv-disadv of both. Though I normally do patients like you Transconjunctivally I think your bags are so large that when they are removed you will have excess skin and therefore need a transcutaneous approach</p><p> Early healing and Early Assymetries It does appear that the eyelid incision on the left is higher than the right one by a few millimeters. Since these are photos, and swelling and other factors can’t be assessed in a face to face examination, I would give the surgeon some benefit of the doubt, and give yourself a minimum of 6-12 months to heal completely</p><p>It may be that the assymmetry of the two sides will improve if the left eye with the higher crease happens to still have more bruising and swelling than the right side. On the before photo, it appears than the left eyelid looked puffier, and on the after photo, it appears that much of that fat was removed, which can also account for a higher eyelid crease</p><p>Leaving Equal amounts of skin If a revision were to be performed for to even out the creases, my goal is to “leave” an equal amount of skin from below the eyebrow hairs to the eyelid crease, and the eyelid crease to the eyelash line<br>

</div>If the skin below the eyebrow and the eyelid crease is equal on both sides, then a tiny strip of skin should be removed from the existing crease toward the eyelash line. When measuring the skin removal, some surgeons will try to remove an equal amount of skin, which makes sense, as long as the skin that is left on the patient is also equal on both above and below the eyelid crease
<p>I usually take 10-15 minutes before the procedure to measure with a fine caliper and a green forceps to “estimate the excess skin” and mark the incision location, as well as the amount of skin removed and the amount of skin left<br>

</div>I rarely make the perfect line on the first try and need to go back and forth between the two eyelids to come to a “compromise” between the two sides. I’ve seen on the television plastic surgery shows where they mark the upper eyelids “free hand” while making all of the other facial markings, but I don’t feel I am able to do the same without using strict measurements at key areas
<p>Upper eyelid hollowing Looking closely at the before photos, your eyes look puffier, with the left upper eyelid puffier than the right side. On both after photos, the puffiness on both sides appear flatter, but in particular on the left side, it appears that the upper rim of the eye socket is visible<br>

</div>People with naturally deep set eyes tend to have this type of upper eyelid hollowing. This hollowing is also another reason for the higher eyelid crease. The right eyelid looks puffier than the left, so it is also possible, that as the swelling comes down on the right side, the right crease will also become higher and match closer to the left side
<p>Raising one eyebrow Another observation that I have seen is that patients who have upper eyelid hollowing tend to raise their eyebrows more on the hollowed side. You had a tendency to raise your left eyebrow before surgery as well as after surgery Go to a mirror, and push your left eyebrow down a bit to match the height of your right side and see if the eyelid crease heights become more even<br>

</div>If so, the surgeon can only do so much during surgical eye lift to perform an accurate surgery, but the surgeon can’t control how a patient may hold their eyebrows assymetrically after surgery. 
<p>Potentially Botox to the forehead on both sides will help to “reset” or “retrain” your forehead muscles and relax the left forehead</p><p>If the left forehead is more relaxed it may also help with the assymetry of the eyelid creases. Don’t worry Depending on how everything settles down with full upper eyelid recover, you will either not need to do anything since the eyelids may even out</p><p>Perhaps a small revision procedure to even out the skin remaining might be performed on one side. Or non-surgical procedures can be done to lower the upper eyelid crease by adding back volume to the upper eyelid hollow<br>

</div>Please check out the link below, which shows a patient of mine who had her upper eyelid crease lowered.
<p><em>Brow Lift vs Blepharoplasty</em></p><p>Although there are many approaches to brow lifts, almost all of them are more invasive than upper blepharoplasty in Bay Area. The more important question, however, is which procedure is better suited to your individual situation. </p><p><i>Under eye area with indentations – dark areas</i></p><p>Your situation is a challenging problem and frankly, as you have already seen, there are various opinions on the solution. The potential causes are : (a) thin skin with vascular structures under the skin showing through, (b) hyper pigmentation, (c) both, (d) attachment of the muscle to the bone with slight weakness of the orbital septum above the rim which could lead to shadowing<br>

</div>While I agree with the suggestion of a trial of hydroquinone, I am less enthusiastic about filler in this area. While filler can be successful here the potential issues can be significant, such as (a) sudden blindness from an intra-arterial injection (rare), or (b) over injection with deformity and swelling, and (c) retroseptal injection with serious long term and potentially permanent deformity not amenable to hyaluronidase injections
<p>In addition fat injections in this area can also be problematic with varying degrees of graft failure and even scarring and lid retraction. Having said that, I do , with great caution, and only in selected patients,use light and forgiving filler in this area in a very suttle and graduated fashion over several visits (Bolotero, Prevelle)<br>

</div>I do not use Juvederm here, but if the first type of filler is tolerated well I will use restylane later. 
<p>I also use a blunt needle to minimize intra-arterial injection risk. As for fat grafting I do not do this as an isolated injection but in conjunction with a muscle lift procedure to lift and tighten the lower lid in a perfectly natural fashion, which is done entirely through a micro-incision lateral to the lower lid and not in or through the lower lid as is done with classic blepharoplasty which I consider no longer necessary in most patients</p><p>In general I try to use the native medial fat pad to fill this area after releasing the muscle from the orbital rim, but if a medial fat pad is not available (rare), then I will use fat grafts placed under direct vision through the tiny lateral incision which heals without evidence it was ever there</p><p>The muscle support is improved with the lift which also helps as you can see in your smiling photo when you tighten the lower lid muscle. If you would like information on this procedure I have been doing since 2007, you can find the original article in PRS October 2013 or you can google “Lateral Access Recontouring of the lower lid”</p><p> Try the non-operative stuff first and if you still are bothered by this look into the surgical eye lift. </p><h3> Upper eyelid scars after blepharoplasty</h3><p>If the upper eyelid scars on the lateral portion of the eyelids is visible, then a simple scar revision can be performed under local anesthesia to hide the incision in a crows feet line. </p><p><em>Doctor prices in 2012:</em></p><ul>
