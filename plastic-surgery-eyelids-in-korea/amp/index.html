If you are Asian and have a double eyelid but still have hooding of your upper eyelids, you probably have excess skin and fat in your upper eyelids. Asian eyelid surgery will remove the excess skin and fat that is causing the hooding.</p><p>Therefore, I think that you would benefit from Asian eyelid surgery. .</p><p><b>Asian Eyelid Surgery for Hooded Eyelids?</b></p><p>The procedure you need to research is Asian eyelid surgery. A true specialist in Asian eyelid surgery would best offer you the proper procedure indicated for your eyelids. Most often, a blepharoplasty and/or brow lift would accomplish what you are asking. You may want to research Asian blepharoplasty as well. </p><p><b>Eyelids surgery in Korea</b> is usually not very painful. Most patients have swelling rathere than discomfort from the surgery. The eyes will fell kind of “full” and stiff for a while. </p><h5>Pain control post op upper eyelid surgery</h5><p>Most upper eyelid surgery is described as uncomfortable but not painful. I often write for a few doses of narcotics which help folks sleep more easily post op. I have never irritated a boil but if you have and are here to tell, I bet you’ll do just fine with your lid surgery</p><p><strong>See an oculoplastic surgeon to correct protruding lacrimal gland</strong></p><p>See an oculoplastic surgeon who has lots of experience performing this type of surgery. It is important to have the gland re-suspended up into the orbital area and not have the gland removed; otherwise you will have dry eyes<br>

</div>It is important to have good functioning of the lacrimal gland; however, it needs to be tucked up inside the orbital rim, when it is hanging down it creates a visual deformity. 
<p><strong>Excess upper eyelid fullness may be due to a prominent lacrimal gland</strong></p><p> It appears as though you have a combination of excess skin and protruding lacrimal glands of your upper eyelids. The lacrimal gland is stitched up to the bone around the eyes to hold it up and in place</p><p>The excess skin is then trimmed off. The recovery is pretty easy with minimal discomfort. </p><p><i>Please do not become an eyelid surgery cripple.</i></p><p>Uou most likely could have avoided surgery by having hyaluronic acid filler for the under eyes. In the after photos you are smiling not doubt to demonstrate how your lower eyelid heaps now that you have had eyelid surgery<br>

</div>I think you need to take steps that are less likely to get you into trouble. Fillers with a very experienced injector is recommended. I would definitely stay away from alloderm or fat grafting. While fillers do need to be maintained, once you find the right injector, these treatments last well over a year
<p><strong>Post-blepharoplasty asymmetry</strong></p><p>Although you notice and are bothered by the 1 mm. scleral show and the asymmetry, it is too small of a difference for surgery or other treatments to reliably correct. </p><p>The margin of error in most treatments is going to be as great or even greater than your problem. It is also impossible to fully evaluate your anatomy based on only a frontal view.<br>

</div><h5>Scleral Show after Blepharoplasty</h5><p>You had a total of 4 surgeries on your lower lids with only minimal result from the three canthopexies. This tells me that your lower lids do not respond to modest surgical tightening but would require a formal canthoplasty for additional repositioning and change</p><p>You will need to make the decision whether this is really worth it to you but I definitely would not just “try” something – especially when it comes to the delicate lower eyelid! Often, a conservate approach (watchful waiting, injectable fillers – maybe) will give you the best outcome</p><p>Your scleral show is mild. A canthoplasty only on one side may result in new asymmetries without overall aesthetic gain. </p><h5>Eyelid issues</h5><p>Your eyes are fine right now, do nothing. Given your genetics you may be headed toward an upper bleph in yout mid to late 30’s but not yet.<br>

</div>Its possible to have familial low brow or heavy hooded eyelids
<p>You will do well with a simple blepharoplasty </p><h4>Blepharoplasty under local perfectly acceptable</h4><p>It is certainly fine to do an upper lid bleph under local anesthesia, especially since you are only having skin removal. I don’t know if this was your choice, your doctor’s recommendation or both. It is very rare when I recommend this unless a patient has very hollow eyes to begin with</p><p>I hope if this is your insistance you are not short changing yourself with the result.

</div>Upper eyelid blepharoplasty can be and is often performed with local anesthesia, local anesthesia with oral medications, or IV sedation. 
<p>You will feel the local anesthesia injections if you choose that route, but they are very well tolerated by most patients. If you feel that you will be unable to lie still while your surgeon is operating on you (despite feeling no pain after the local anesthetic injections), then it would be better to do this with IV sedation</p><p>The end result should be the same regardless of anesthetic type. </p><h5>Eyelid surgery</h5><p>You don’t appear to have skin laxity, so a transconjunctival approach would be better.  Make sure you specifically look at before and after pictures of real patients who have had this surgery performed by your surgeon and evaluate their results<br>

<em>A blepharoplasty may be all you need</em><p>From the photograph you sent it appears that you are raising your eyebrows at the time the flash went off. So without an examination the extent of your drooping is hard to assess. But surgery will be a great help to your appearance and the end result will make people say you look more awake and less sad</p><p>The actual type of surgery you need can only be assessed on a physical exam. If the lashes of your upper lid hang over your pupil when you are not rasing them with your forehead muscle then you may need some correction in the muscles that control your lid opening</p><p>Again that can only be assessed on an exam not on a photo. </p><h3>Drooping upper eyelids</h3><p>Droopy eyelids can be addressed by upper eyelid surgery. This can sometimes be covered by medical insurance if it is affecting your vision. A visual field test is done to determine this objectively. There are different methods of repair that your surgeon would discuss with you after examining you</p><p><strong>Transconjunctival vs transcutaneous lower blepharoplasty</strong></p><p>it doesnt look like there is a significant amount of excess skin present. I would definitely recommend transconjunctival lower blepharoplasty for you. We surgeons love having patients like you come in, because there is a lot of excess fatty tissue present and you will likely have a very dramatic improvement from the surgery<br>
</p>
<div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2622" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-7732a6bae8be1022dc3a3df27362b253">

</div>In transconjunctival surgery, the incision will be on the back of your eyelid so there is no visible scar and little to no risk of eyelid retraction after the surgery. I reserve transcutaneous lower eyelid surgery for patients with laxity in their lower eyelids and a lot of excess skin
<p><i>In my opinion, you are going to have issues with either surgery.</i></p><p>However, you are going to have far more issues with transcutaneous lower blepharoplasty in Korea. You have a very large eye. You have poor support for the lower eyelid with relative lack of cheek bone projection (negative vector lower eyelid)</p><p>Transcutaneous lower eyelid surgery violated the orbicularis oculi muscle to access the fat. In about 70% of patients this results in permanent weakening of the pretarsal orbicularis oculi muscle responsible for holding the lower eyelid against the eye<br>

</div>Lateral canthoplasty or pexy is often performed to compensate for this loss of motor nerve function. However, this procedure also pulls the lower eyelid down. For this reason, I advise transconjunctival lower eyelid surgery with preservation of the lower eyelid fat and relocation of this material to the top of the cheek (arcus marginalia release surgery)
<p>You may also need very gentle lateral canthal support at the time of surgery. </p><p>I think a filler with or without a bleaching topical agent would give you great results. On the other had if you were inclined for a surgical result blepharoplasty with fat transposition or fat grafting might give you good results also<br>

</div><h5>Tear troughs</h5><p>Tear troughs can be corrected with filler such as restylane. This is an office procedure and does not change the way the rest of your face looks. The good thing also about restylane is that if you dont like it, the product can be melted away with an injection</p><h4>Lower eyelid bags and discoloration</h4><p>As you can see from the many answers given here, there is no one “magic bullet” to treat dark circles and bags under the lower eyelids. The reason for the difficulty in treatment is the multi-factorial cause of this</p><p>Many cases are due to age – related changes in the bony skeleton, the skin, as well as the soft tissues. Hereditary factors may also play a role. Fillers, fat transfer and lower eyelid blepharoplasty in Korea (or some combination of these) are all reasonable options<br>

</div><h4>What Can I Do to Lessen Scars After Blepharoplasty?</h4><p>Most patients manage the scars by massage. I found the drug falumiare helps to lift the scars. If your scars do not heal as you’d hoped, I do recommend that patients undergo blepharoplasty scar incision as long as their scar problems mechanically with their ability to close the eye a small scar will most likely improve your circumstance if it has appropriate scar management clearing up</p><p><i>There are many options for managing post-surgical scars.</i></p><p>There are many options for managing post-surgical scars.

Consult with your surgeon, or look for a facial plastic surgeon with experience in scar revision<br>

<b>Scarring Following Blepharoplasty Occasionally Occurs; Surgical Intervention – Scar Revision – May be Necessary</b><p>When upper lid blepharoplasty in Korea is performed, every effort is made to hide the incisions. On the upper eyelids, the incisions are hidden in the eyelid crease where they’re extremely difficult to see. Unfortunately in cases where there is lateral hooding and large amounts of excess skin, the incision needs to be extended beyond the crease</p><p>This explains the location of your incision. Occasionally, scars in this region spread and can be noticeable. It generally takes 12 to 18 months for scars to reach their maximum improvement.
